What follows is a justification of <em>why Obsidian did not work for me</em>, not a takedown of Obsidian itself, because I think Obsidian is great at what it is intended for. But I don't think Obsidian is a program that I should continue using.</p>\n\n<p>My problems with Obsidian play into a bigger battle for balance I've been struggling with for the last couple years or so: How much digital is enough? Or maybe the question should be: How much screen time is enough? </p>\n\n<p>Like so much work in the 21st century, my day job sees me almost exclusively planted in front of a computer monitor. On top of that, I'm also in front of screens for so much of my leisure time. These days, most writing is performed on a computer. I read my RSS feeds via the computer. I watch YouTube videos or take classes via Coursera. In June I'll be starting an online technical writing certification program. Much of my shopping is performed online. I'm directionally challenged, so I rely on my smartphone's GPS to get me from A to B. Oh yeah, and don't forget about podcasts and the music synced from my Plex server I listen to on that same screen that conveniently fits in my pocket. </p>\n\n<p>It's no secret why so many of us use screens so often. They're efficient. The possibilities are damn near endless.</p>\n\n<p>But how much screen time do I need? I've made great strides in reducing my screen time over the last couple years, and I still use screens way too much. </p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, Obsidian is just another thing to keep me in front of a screen more often. Perhaps paradoxically, using Obsidian pushed me back to bullet journaling. It made me realize that I still wanted some things to be handled in an analog manner. While I acknowledge that screens often allow us to be more productive, I'm not sure they consistently always allow us to be more creative. For me, there's something about pulling out the old pen and paper. It's as if slowing down in such a way gives me the opportunity to sort through the noise and find something to pursue. </p>\n\n<p>While I see the benefits of Obsidian, I don't think it's something I should continue to use. For me, it's just something else to get lost in and distracted by. Perhaps I would feel differently if I had different aims, but my ambitions outside of my day job relate to writing and becoming a better writer. I'm not sure Obsidian empowers my ambitions any more than pen and paper and iA writer. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps Obsidian is a casualty of my becoming set in my ways. I won't deny that possibility, but if that's the case, this is one case in which I'm not going to fight it. Either way, I'm better off just doing what I'm doing. Not everything is about efficiency and productivity after all. Some things should be done if not only for joy, then primarily for joy.

I don&rsquo;t listen to complete albums. I don&rsquo;t obsess over the details of the production and instrumentation, the stories behind the songs. And that&rsquo;s what one would expect, because I&rsquo;m an adult with responsibilities, and my time is more precious than it was when I was a teenager in podunk Louisiana, using music as my escape.</p>\n\n<p>But man, how I used to get high on tunes. I remember the drama of downloading songs via Napster on my home computer&rsquo;s 19.2kbps dial-up connection. So many times I&rsquo;d wait nearly an hour for a song to download, only to have the connection severed at the end, leaving the file incomplete and unusable. I also searched out albums on the Tower Records website and then sat in agony over the next few days&ndash;or maybe it was weeks; I&rsquo;ve been spoiled so long by Amazon&rsquo;s two-day deliveries that I forget what it was like before&ndash;and there was little as exciting as getting new CDs in the mail. I used to love playing a CD low while I slept, one of my favorites being My Bloody Valentine&rsquo;s <em>Loveless</em>. (Side note: I think My Bloody Valentine&rsquo;s &ldquo;When You Sleep&rdquo; is the most interesting song to search for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=when+you+sleep+cover\">covers on YouTube</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>My best friend in college is the only person from my Louisiana days that I stay in frequent contact with. While we&rsquo;ve both grown over the years&ndash;and so has our relationship&ndash;it all started due to music, when I complimented his t-shirt of The Cure&rsquo;s <em>Disintegration</em> album, my favorite of all time. We soon discovered we liked many of the same bands beyond The Cure: Joy Division, Pixies, Primal Scream, My Bloody Valentine, etc. Music wasn&rsquo;t our only thing. We enjoyed many of the same movies. We played video games. We both loved <a href=\"https://www.johnnysph.com\">Johnny&rsquo;s Pizza</a>. But I doubt we would have ever had the friendship I cherish if it weren&rsquo;t for music.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, someone on micro.blog&ndash;I believe it was <a href=\"https://andrewdoran.uk/blog/?s=bandcamp&amp;submit=Search\">Andrew Doran</a>&ndash;was pushing <a href=\"https://bandcamp.com\">Bandcamp</a> as a great platform for musicians. I had used Bandcamp in the past and had just a few months before bought my first album on there, but for some reason, this post resonated with me and convinced me to dive a bit deeper, resulting in the purchase of ten more albums, the most recent being this morning&rsquo;s purchase of <em>Yawn</em> by <a href=\"https://billryderjonesmusic.bandcamp.com\">Bill Ryder-Jones</a>. Jones is one of my favorite new-to-me artists of the last few years, and <em>Yawn</em> is persistently melancholy, making for great music to reminisce to.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last few weeks listening to music I have paid for.

The stock market looked as if it could go only up. And it was a given that America would be business-as-usual on any given day.</p>\n\n<p>When was the last time the whole nation slowed down? The 1970s oil crisis? World War II, when everyone had to sacrifice in some way to support the war effort?

If you go to a restaurant and find yourself wondering what &ldquo;Texas size&rdquo; means, rest assured it ain&rsquo;t the diet portion.</p>\n\n<p>So when Texas gets a taste of a winter storm, it gets a BIG taste. As I said before, I lost power for significant portions of last week, but some people were without power and water for days. Some people&rsquo;s homes were destroyed due to water damage from burst pipes. The damage was big and the insurance claims will be big and the FEMA relief will likely be big.</p>\n\n<p>This experience prompted me to ask, When was the last time I had to go without power for multiple days? I imagine I last experienced this in the &lsquo;90s as a kid when north Louisiana got hit with a freak ice storm. (And my wife wonders why I hate the cold.)</p>\n\n<p>We take for granted that we&rsquo;ll have electricity, running water, and natural gas at our beck and call. We expect restaurants and businesses to be open. We expect grocery stores to keep their shelves stocked with everything we could want or need.</p>\n\n<p>And yet it takes only one chill to derail it all. To bring West Texas oil production to a halt. To negate the streak of comfort we grew accustomed to.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, maybe <a href=\"https://us11.campaign-archive.com/?u=de2bc41f8324e6955ef65e0c9&amp;id=696481ad49\">the fallout wouldn&rsquo;t have been so drastic if Texas&rsquo;s power infrastructure were properly winterized</a>, but don&rsquo;t tell Governor Abbott that as he seeks to blame anything else for the disaster.</p>\n\n<p>Onward to Lesson #2:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"no-matter-how-impressive-an-individual-or-organization-remember-that-he-or-it-can-still-falter\">No matter how impressive an individual or organization, remember that he or it can still falter.</h2>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s early 2021. The world has at least three vaccines. America, whose citizens found a way to all but guarantee two-day shipping to nearly every corner of the lower 48, can&rsquo;t roll out doses in a timely manner. Yes, there are some unusual circumstances, such as at least one of the vaccines needing to be stored at extreme cold temperatures, but there have been problems getting doses to people who want them even when the vaccine has reached vaccination locations.</p>\n\n<p>If you had to say that America had <em>only one thing</em> figured out, logistics would be a good candidate. And yet we&rsquo;re pooping on ourselves in a crucial moment.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, I don&rsquo;t mean to come across as pointing the finger. In light of my ignorance, I know that this vaccine rollout is far more complex than I will ever understand. But one of the keys to daily contentedness lies in managing one&rsquo;s expectations. And we need to start expecting things to go wrong more often, and if they don&rsquo;t go wrong&ndash;well, hopefully we&rsquo;ll be that much more appreciative.</p>\n\n<p>That brings me to lesson #3, which is more of a general bonus lesson rather than one tied to 2020 and beyond:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"don-t-compare-a-situation-to-an-ideal-of-utopia-instead-compare-it-to-its-past-iterations\">Don&rsquo;t compare a situation to an ideal of Utopia. Instead compare it to its past iterations.</h2>\n\n<p>When I hear people criticize a system they&rsquo;ve become disenchanted with, they usually jump to the question of why isn&rsquo;t the system better AKA perfect.</p>\n\n<p>To give an example that (hopefully) won&rsquo;t anger anyone, you&rsquo;ve likely seen people online asking why we didn&rsquo;t get hoverboards back in 2015 like the <em>Back to the Future</em> franchise promised back in the &lsquo;80s. I know, it&rsquo;s easy to feel as if we&rsquo;ve been cheated. But keep in mind that just over 100 years ago, we had to travel by horse and buggy. A trip that now takes an hour in your car might have been a multiple-day trip, depending on the terrain and conditions. And then you&rsquo;d get halfway there, and your horse would step in some soft ground and break his leg and you&rsquo;d have to take him out like Old Yeller and ask yourself whether you want to head back home or continue on to your destination on foot. When I look at it that way, I&rsquo;m fine missing out on hoverboards.</p></p>\n\n<p><p>For the record, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that we should only be content with what we have and not strive for progress or something better. But we should hold close an appreciation of where we&rsquo;ve come from. Also, acknowledging progress made gives a bit of hope, because if we&rsquo;ve done better in the past, there&rsquo;s no reason we can&rsquo;t do better in the future. But looking ahead to a Utopia that will never exist actually does the opposite: It gives the impression that we will never achieve greatness.</p>\n\n<p>And of course, you may say that 100 years is so long ago, we should expect to have it much better. But keep in mind that 100 years is now little more than a lifetime (at least in America).</p>\n\n<p>The world changes in the blink of an eye. If you&rsquo;re not convinced of that, at least acknowledge that <em>your</em> world can chance in such a span.</p>\n\n<p>And 2020 and beyond have shown me the importance of being mentally prepared for the possibilities.</p>",

And yet we're pooping on ourselves in a crucial moment.\n\nTo be clear, I don't mean to come across as pointing the finger. In light of my ignorance, I know that this vaccine rollout is far more complex than I will ever understand. But one of the keys to daily contentedness lies in managing one's expectations. And we need to start expecting things to go wrong more often, and if they don't go wrong--well, hopefully we'll be that much more appreciative.\n\nThat brings me to lesson #3, which is more of a general bonus lesson rather than one tied to 2020 and beyond:\n\n## Don't compare a situation to an ideal of Utopia. Instead compare it to its past iterations.\n\nWhen I hear people criticize a system they've become disenchanted with, they usually jump to the question of why isn't the system better AKA perfect.\n\nTo give an example that (hopefully) won't anger anyone, you've likely seen people online asking why we didn't get hoverboards back in 2015 like the <em>Back to the Future</em> franchise promised back in the '80s. I know, it's easy to feel as if we've been cheated. But keep in mind that just over 100 years ago, we had to travel by horse and buggy. A trip that now takes an hour in your car might have been a multiple-day trip, depending on the terrain and conditions. And then you'd get halfway there, and your horse would step in some soft ground and break his leg and you'd have to take him out like Old Yeller and ask yourself whether you want to head back home or continue on to your destination on foot. When I look at it that way, I'm fine missing out on hoverboards.</p>\n\n<p>For the record, this doesn't mean that we should only be content with what we have and not strive for progress or something better. But we should hold close an appreciation of where we've come from. Also, acknowledging progress made gives a bit of hope, because if we've done better in the past, there's no reason we can't do better in the future. But looking ahead to a Utopia that will never exist actually does the opposite: It gives the impression that we will never achieve greatness.\n\nAnd of course, you may say that 100 years is so long ago, we should expect to have it much better. But keep in mind that 100 years is now little more than a lifetime (at least in America).\n\nThe world changes in the blink of an eye. If you're not convinced of that, at least acknowledge that *your* world can chance in such a span.\n\nAnd 2020 and beyond have shown me the importance of being mentally prepared for the possibilities.\n",

From my experience, most people in the Dallas-Fort Worth area are unaware of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora,_Texas,_UFO_incident\">Aurora, Texas, UFO incident</a>, even though it happened practically in their back yard.</p>\n\n<p>Long story short, way back in 1897&ndash;before the Wright brothers blasted their fly rides into the sky and made it cry&ndash;a cigar-shaped spaceship wrecked into a windmill on the judge&rsquo;s property. The pilot, some tiny human-like creature, was buried in the local cemetery.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakelacaze.com/uploads/2021/56cccde059.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Of course, any good alien story has to have some additional layers to it.</p>\n\n<p>Supposedly, some metal from the wreckage was thrown into the property&rsquo;s water well and a future owner would claim that the well water gave him gout and so he closed the well in.</p>\n\n<p>When the locals buried the little alien man, they left a grave marker, which was supposedly later retrieved by the army.

				"content_text": "When you hear about Texas, a few things may come to mind:\n\n- Cowboys\n- The Alamo\n- Salsa and cheese dip\n- Big AF state\n\nYou likely don't think of the state as possibly being home to America's first UFO crash, which took place 50 years before the better-known Roswell incident. From my experience, most people in the Dallas-Fort Worth area are unaware of the [Aurora, Texas, UFO incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora,_Texas,_UFO_incident), even though it happened practically in their back yard.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nLong story short, way back in 1897--before the Wright brothers blasted their fly rides into the sky and made it cry--a cigar-shaped spaceship wrecked into a windmill on the judge's property. The pilot, some tiny human-like creature, was buried in the local cemetery. \n\n![](https://jakelacaze.com/uploads/2021/56cccde059.jpg)\n\nOf course, any good alien story has to have some additional layers to it.\n\nSupposedly, some metal from the wreckage was thrown into the property's water well and a future owner would claim that the well water gave him gout and so he closed the well in.\n\nWhen the locals buried the little alien man, they left a grave marker, which was supposedly later retrieved by the army. Truth ears have replaced the marker numerous times with some sort of rock or object over the decades. The cemetery will not allow anyone to exhume the alien, but [according to the History Channel's UFO Hunters](https://youtu.be/nOHpQd7TtFg), there is a collapsed and deteriorated grave at the alien's plot.\n\nPerhaps this story isn't better known because it has been nearly unanimously accepted as legend and was most likely a PR stunt by a local journalist to stir up interest in the dying town.
