				"content_html": "<p>For me, getting older has been a bit of a mixed bag. In some ways, life gets easier as I figure things out and learn to prioritize what truly matters. If you&rsquo;re struggling with this, consider checking out <a href=\"http://micro.blog/books/0062457713\">Mark Manson&rsquo;s book on the matter</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, I suppose it&rsquo;s only natural to long for the good old days, a time when the world made sense and we were flexible enough to adapt.</p>\n\n<p>For me, one of the saddest parts about getting older is that I don&rsquo;t listen to music the way I used to. I don&rsquo;t listen to complete albums. I don&rsquo;t obsess over the details of the production and instrumentation, the stories behind the songs. And that&rsquo;s what one would expect, because I&rsquo;m an adult with responsibilities, and my time is more precious than it was when I was a teenager in podunk Louisiana, using music as my escape.</p>\n\n<p>But man, how I used to get high on tunes. I remember the drama of downloading songs via Napster on my home computer&rsquo;s 19.2kbps dial-up connection. So many times I&rsquo;d wait nearly an hour for a song to download, only to have the connection severed at the end, leaving the file incomplete and unusable. I also searched out albums on the Tower Records website and then sat in agony over the next few days&ndash;or maybe it was weeks; I&rsquo;ve been spoiled so long by Amazon&rsquo;s two-day deliveries that I forget what it was like before&ndash;and there was little as exciting as getting new CDs in the mail. I used to love playing a CD low while I slept, one of my favorites being My Bloody Valentine&rsquo;s <em>Loveless</em>. (Side note: I think My Bloody Valentine&rsquo;s &ldquo;When You Sleep&rdquo; is the most interesting song to search for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=when+you+sleep+cover\">covers on YouTube</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>My best friend in college is the only person from my Louisiana days that I stay in frequent contact with. While we&rsquo;ve both grown over the years&ndash;and so has our relationship&ndash;it all started due to music, when I complimented his t-shirt of The Cure&rsquo;s <em>Disintegration</em> album, my favorite of all time. We soon discovered we liked many of the same bands beyond The Cure: Joy Division, Pixies, Primal Scream, My Bloody Valentine, etc. Music wasn&rsquo;t our only thing. We enjoyed many of the same movies. We played video games. We both loved <a href=\"https://www.johnnysph.com\">Johnny&rsquo;s Pizza</a>.

				"content_text": "For me, getting older has been a bit of a mixed bag. In some ways, life gets easier as I figure things out and learn to prioritize what truly matters. If you're struggling with this, consider checking out [Mark Manson's book on the matter](http://micro.blog/books/0062457713).\n\nOn the other hand, I suppose it's only natural to long for the good old days, a time when the world made sense and we were flexible enough to adapt.\n\nFor me, one of the saddest parts about getting older is that I don't listen to music the way I used to. I don't listen to complete albums. I don't obsess over the details of the production and instrumentation, the stories behind the songs. And that's what one would expect, because I'm an adult with responsibilities, and my time is more precious than it was when I was a teenager in podunk Louisiana, using music as my escape.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nBut man, how I used to get high on tunes. I remember the drama of downloading songs via Napster on my home computer's 19.2kbps dial-up connection. So many times I'd wait nearly an hour for a song to download, only to have the connection severed at the end, leaving the file incomplete and unusable. I also searched out albums on the Tower Records website and then sat in agony over the next few days--or maybe it was weeks; I've been spoiled so long by Amazon's two-day deliveries that I forget what it was like before--and there was little as exciting as getting new CDs in the mail. I used to love playing a CD low while I slept, one of my favorites being My Bloody Valentine's *Loveless*. (Side note: I think My Bloody Valentine's \"When You Sleep\" is the most interesting song to search for [covers on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=when+you+sleep+cover).)\n\nMy best friend in college is the only person from my Louisiana days that I stay in frequent contact with. While we've both grown over the years--and so has our relationship--it all started due to music, when I complimented his t-shirt of The Cure's *Disintegration* album, my favorite of all time. We soon discovered we liked many of the same bands beyond The Cure: Joy Division, Pixies, Primal Scream, My Bloody Valentine, etc. Music wasn't our only thing. We enjoyed many of the same movies. We played video games. We both loved [Johnny's Pizza](https://www.johnnysph.com). But I doubt we would have ever had the friendship I cherish if it weren't for music.\n\nRecently, someone on micro.blog--I believe it was [Andrew Doran](https://andrewdoran.uk/blog/?s=bandcamp&submit=Search)--was pushing [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com) as a great platform for musicians. I had used Bandcamp in the past and had just a few months before bought my first album on there, but for some reason, this post resonated with me and convinced me to dive a bit deeper, resulting in the purchase of ten more albums, the most recent being this morning's purchase of *Yawn* by [Bill Ryder-Jones](https://billryderjonesmusic.bandcamp.com). Jones is one of my favorite new-to-me artists of the last few years, and *Yawn* is persistently melancholy, making for great music to reminisce to.\n\nI've spent the last few weeks listening to music I have paid for. I find I'm more likely to listen to a complete album, to experience the whole piece. Music matters more again. It inspires more again.

I know, it&rsquo;s easy to feel as if we&rsquo;ve been cheated. But keep in mind that just over 100 years ago, we had to travel by horse and buggy. A trip that now takes an hour in your car might have been a multiple-day trip, depending on the terrain and conditions. And then you&rsquo;d get halfway there, and your horse would step in some soft ground and break his leg and you&rsquo;d have to take him out like Old Yeller and ask yourself whether you want to head back home or continue on to your destination on foot.

Just remember: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqz5dbs5zmo\">Cool guys don’t look at explosions.</a> They blow things up and then walk away.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"writerly-goals\">Writerly goals</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"read-30-books\">Read 30 books</h3>\n\n<p>I’m not sure how many books I read in any given year because I’ve never kept a list, even though I’ve said I was going to numerous times. I want to set a reading goal, but the fashionable “50 books in a year” seems a bit much for me. For one, I’m a slow reader. And life happens and more important things get in the way. 30 seems like a reasonable goal for nearly anyone, so I’m going to give it a shot in 2021.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"take-3-writing-classes\">Take 3 writing classes</h3>\n\n<p>Writing is my hobby, one I want to invest more into. Last year I took a technical writing class. This year I want to take three writing classes. I don’t care whether the classes pertain to professional writing or creative writing, and I can get them on the cheap with <a href=\"https://coursera.org\">Coursera</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"entertainment\">Entertainment</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"finish-watching-kids-in-the-hall\">Finish watching <em>Kids in the Hall</em></h3>\n\n<p>I bought the series DVD collection for <em>Kids in the Hall</em> two years ago. I’m pretty sure one of my unofficial goals for 2020 was to finish watching the series. I can’t believe I didn’t do it, since I, like most other people, spent more time at home in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>As it stands, I’m about halfway through Season 2. That leaves about 75 episodes. Gotta get busy planting myself in front of the idiot box.</p>\n\n<p>And while we’re at it I might as well finish rewatching <em>Chappelle’s Show</em>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"fashion\">Fashion</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"no-more-blue-jeans\">No more blue jeans</h3>\n\n<p>Look, blue jeans suck. They’re heavy and uncomfortable. Ugh. There are better options: khakis, chinos, going nude.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone knows that these days, real activism needs a hashtag, so join me in making #nodenimin2021 a reality.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"onward-to-2021\">Onward to 2021</h2>\n\n<p>I thought I could come up with more goals, but seeing how the universe threw a curveball and wrecked all my plans for 2020, maybe it’s best to keep things simple this year.</p>\n\n<p>Happy New Year, y’all</p>",

Just remember: [Cool guys don’t look at explosions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqz5dbs5zmo) They blow things up and then walk away.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## Writerly goals\n\n### Read 30 books\n\nI’m not sure how many books I read in any given year because I’ve never kept a list, even though I’ve said I was going to numerous times. I want to set a reading goal, but the fashionable “50 books in a year” seems a bit much for me. For one, I’m a slow reader. And life happens and more important things get in the way. 30 seems like a reasonable goal for nearly anyone, so I’m going to give it a shot in 2021.\n\n### Take 3 writing classes\n\nWriting is my hobby, one I want to invest more into. Last year I took a technical writing class. This year I want to take three writing classes. I don’t care whether the classes pertain to professional writing or creative writing, and I can get them on the cheap with [Coursera](https://coursera.org).\n\n## Entertainment\n\n### Finish watching *Kids in the Hall*\n\nI bought the series DVD collection for *Kids in the Hall* two years ago. I’m pretty sure one of my unofficial goals for 2020 was to finish watching the series. I can’t believe I didn’t do it, since I, like most other people, spent more time at home in 2020.\n\nAs it stands, I’m about halfway through Season 2. That leaves about 75 episodes. Gotta get busy planting myself in front of the idiot box.\n\nAnd while we’re at it I might as well finish rewatching *Chappelle’s Show*.\n\n## Fashion\n\n### No more blue jeans\n\nLook, blue jeans suck. They’re heavy and uncomfortable. Ugh. There are better options: khakis, chinos, going nude.\n\nEveryone knows that these days, real activism needs a hashtag, so join me in making #nodenimin2021 a reality.\n\n## Onward to 2021\n\nI thought I could come up with more goals, but seeing how the universe threw a curveball and wrecked all my plans for 2020, maybe it’s best to keep things simple this year.\n\nHappy New Year, y’all\n\n",
