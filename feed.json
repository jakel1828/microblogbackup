				"content_html": "\n\n<p>2020 is behind us, but the mood carries on, so we find ourselves in limbo, able to reflect on our recent past while still experiencing it.</p>\n\n<p>On December 31, it seemed as if most people were optimistic that 2021 was going to be instantly better than 2020. But as the coronavirus has persisted and after the Capitol riots, a co-worker and I agreed that 2021 is just 2020 overtime. I&rsquo;m glad I prepared myself for the possibility that <a href=\"https://jakelacaze.com/2021/01/09/ep-what-if.html\">2021 may suck harder than 2020</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Last week, Texas was hit with an epic storm. Millions lost power. Some lost water or had to boil before use. Compared to some, my family was lucky. We were without power for most of Monday and Tuesday, but we did have little blocks of time in which we were electrified, allowing us to recharge our devices and prep meals in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Though this recent polar vortex, arctic blast, deep freeze&ndash;whatever you want to call it&ndash;was a new challenge, in so many ways it echoed my biggest takeaway of 2020:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"even-well-functioning-systems-are-fragile\">Even well-functioning systems are fragile.</h2>\n\n<p>America was on a roll before the pandemic. The stock market looked as if it could go only up. And it was a given that America would be business-as-usual on any given day.</p>\n\n<p>When was the last time the whole nation slowed down? The 1970s oil crisis? World War II, when everyone had to sacrifice in some way to support the war effort? We can argue about the specific answer to the question, but the larger point stays the same: In so many ways, we&rsquo;ve had it so good for so long.</p>\n\n<p>What could possibly derail this gravy train? Apparently, all it took was a virus that mutated in a wet market in some little corner of China. There&rsquo;s no point in recapping what has happened since then: We&rsquo;ve all experienced it and we&rsquo;re all aware, and if this doesn&rsquo;t apply to you, how? Who are you? I wanna know.</p>\n\n<p>Texas is a state proud of its size. At one time while driving around Dallas-Fort Worth, you could find billboard signs advertising that Texas is bigger than France and that DFW Airport than the island of Manhattan. If you go to a restaurant and find yourself wondering what &ldquo;Texas size&rdquo; means, rest assured it ain&rsquo;t the diet portion.</p>\n\n<p>So when Texas gets a taste of a winter storm, it gets a BIG taste. As I said before, I lost power for significant portions of last week, but some people were without power and water for days. Some people&rsquo;s homes were destroyed due to water damage from burst pipes. The damage was big and the insurance claims will be big and the FEMA relief will likely be big.</p>\n\n<p>This experience prompted me to ask, When was the last time I had to go without power for multiple days? I imagine I last experienced this in the &lsquo;90s as a kid when north Louisiana got hit with a freak ice storm. (And my wife wonders why I hate the cold.)</p>\n\n<p>We take for granted that we&rsquo;ll have electricity, running water, and natural gas at our beck and call. We expect restaurants and businesses to be open. We expect grocery stores to keep their shelves stocked with everything we could want or need.</p>\n\n<p>And yet it takes only one chill to derail it all. To bring West Texas oil production to a halt. To negate the streak of comfort we grew accustomed to.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, maybe <a href=\"https://us11.campaign-archive.com/?u=de2bc41f8324e6955ef65e0c9&amp;id=696481ad49\">the fallout wouldn&rsquo;t have been so drastic if Texas&rsquo;s power infrastructure were properly winterized</a>, but don&rsquo;t tell Governor Abbott that as he seeks to blame anything else for the disaster.</p>\n\n<p>Onward to Lesson #2:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"no-matter-how-impressive-an-individual-or-organization-remember-that-he-or-it-can-still-falter\">No matter how impressive an individual or organization, remember that he or it can still falter.</h2>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s early 2021. The world has at least three vaccines. America, whose citizens found a way to all but guarantee two-day shipping to nearly every corner of the lower 48, can&rsquo;t roll out doses in a timely manner. Yes, there are some unusual circumstances, such as at least one of the vaccines needing to be stored at extreme cold temperatures, but there have been problems getting doses to people who want them even when the vaccine has reached vaccination locations.</p>\n\n<p>If you had to say that America had <em>only one thing</em> figured out, logistics would be a good candidate. And yet we&rsquo;re pooping on ourselves in a crucial moment.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, I don&rsquo;t mean to come across as pointing the finger. In light of my ignorance, I know that this vaccine rollout is far more complex than I will ever understand. But one of the keys to daily contentedness lies in managing one&rsquo;s expectations. And we need to start expecting things to go wrong more often, and if they don&rsquo;t go wrong&ndash;well, hopefully we&rsquo;ll be that much more appreciative.</p>\n\n<p>That brings me to lesson #3, which is more of a general bonus lesson rather than one tied to 2020 and beyond:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"don-t-compare-a-situation-to-an-ideal-of-utopia-instead-compare-it-to-its-past-iterations\">Don&rsquo;t compare a situation to an ideal of Utopia. Instead compare it to its past iterations.</h2>\n\n<p>When I hear people criticize a system they&rsquo;ve become disenchanted with, they usually jump to the question of why isn&rsquo;t the system better AKA perfect.</p>\n\n<p>To give an example that (hopefully) won&rsquo;t anger anyone, you&rsquo;ve likely seen people online asking why we didn&rsquo;t get hoverboards back in 2015 like the <em>Back to the Future</em> franchise promised back in the &lsquo;80s. I know, it&rsquo;s easy to feel as if we&rsquo;ve been cheated. But keep in mind that just over 100 years ago, we had to travel by horse and buggy. A trip that now takes an hour in your car might have been a multiple-day trip, depending on the terrain and conditions. And then you&rsquo;d get halfway there, and your horse would step in some soft ground and break his leg and you&rsquo;d have to take him out like Old Yeller and ask yourself whether you want to head back home or continue on to your destination on foot. When I look at it that way, I&rsquo;m fine missing out on hoverboards.</p></p>\n\n<p><p>For the record, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that we should only be content with what we have and not strive for progress or something better. But we should hold close an appreciation of where we&rsquo;ve come from. Also, acknowledging progress made gives a bit of hope, because if we&rsquo;ve done better in the past, there&rsquo;s no reason we can&rsquo;t do better in the future. But looking ahead to a Utopia that will never exist actually does the opposite: It gives the impression that we will never achieve greatness.</p>\n\n<p>And of course, you may say that 100 years is so long ago, we should expect to have it much better. But keep in mind that 100 years is now little more than a lifetime (at least in America).</p>\n\n<p>The world changes in the blink of an eye. If you&rsquo;re not convinced of that, at least acknowledge that <em>your</em> world can chance in such a span.</p>\n\n<p>And 2020 and beyond have shown me the importance of being mentally prepared for the possibilities.</p>\n",

We expect grocery stores to keep their shelves stocked with everything we could want or need.\n\nAnd yet it takes only one chill to derail it all. To bring West Texas oil production to a halt. To negate the streak of comfort we grew accustomed to.\n\nOf course, maybe [the fallout wouldn't have been so drastic if Texas's power infrastructure were properly winterized](https://us11.campaign-archive.com/?u=de2bc41f8324e6955ef65e0c9&id=696481ad49), but don't tell Governor Abbott that as he seeks to blame anything else for the disaster.\n\nOnward to Lesson #2:\n\n## No matter how impressive an individual or organization, remember that he or it can still falter.\n\nIt's early 2021. The world has at least three vaccines. America, whose citizens found a way to all but guarantee two-day shipping to nearly every corner of the lower 48, can't roll out doses in a timely manner. Yes, there are some unusual circumstances, such as at least one of the vaccines needing to be stored at extreme cold temperatures, but there have been problems getting doses to people who want them even when the vaccine has reached vaccination locations.\n\nIf you had to say that America had *only one thing* figured out, logistics would be a good candidate. And yet we're pooping on ourselves in a crucial moment.\n\nTo be clear, I don't mean to come across as pointing the finger. In light of my ignorance, I know that this vaccine rollout is far more complex than I will ever understand. But one of the keys to daily contentedness lies in managing one's expectations. And we need to start expecting things to go wrong more often, and if they don't go wrong--well, hopefully we'll be that much more appreciative.\n\nThat brings me to lesson #3, which is more of a general bonus lesson rather than one tied to 2020 and beyond:\n\n## Don't compare a situation to an ideal of Utopia. Instead compare it to its past iterations.\n\nWhen I hear people criticize a system they've become disenchanted with, they usually jump to the question of why isn't the system better AKA perfect.\n\nTo give an example that (hopefully) won't anger anyone, you've likely seen people online asking why we didn't get hoverboards back in 2015 like the <em>Back to the Future</em> franchise promised back in the '80s. I know, it's easy to feel as if we've been cheated. But keep in mind that just over 100 years ago, we had to travel by horse and buggy. A trip that now takes an hour in your car might have been a multiple-day trip, depending on the terrain and conditions. And then you'd get halfway there, and your horse would step in some soft ground and break his leg and you'd have to take him out like Old Yeller and ask yourself whether you want to head back home or continue on to your destination on foot. When I look at it that way, I'm fine missing out on hoverboards.</p>\n\n<p>For the record, this doesn't mean that we should only be content with what we have and not strive for progress or something better. But we should hold close an appreciation of where we've come from. Also, acknowledging progress made gives a bit of hope, because if we've done better in the past, there's no reason we can't do better in the future. But looking ahead to a Utopia that will never exist actually does the opposite: It gives the impression that we will never achieve greatness.\n\nAnd of course, you may say that 100 years is so long ago, we should expect to have it much better. But keep in mind that 100 years is now little more than a lifetime (at least in America).\n\nThe world changes in the blink of an eye. If you're not convinced of that, at least acknowledge that *your* world can chance in such a span.\n\nAnd 2020 and beyond have shown me the importance of being mentally prepared for the possibilities.\n",

Some will harken back to the good old days of driving out to a rancher&rsquo;s property and discussing business among prospect maps spread over the hood of a pickup truck and closing deals with handshakes. If you stick around long enough in this field&ndash;I&rsquo;m nearing my thirteenth year&ndash;you likely develop at least a passing interest in the history of the land and the minerals underneath. And the history of the owners, sometimes leading to revelations of betrayal and the accompanying family feuds. When researching title, you may become more familiar with other people&rsquo;s family trees than you are of your own. And don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you that wills, probate proceedings, and affidavits can&rsquo;t be exciting&ndash;sometimes you find some four-letter words and some spicy accusations in those documents.</p>\n\n<p>A desire to advance my career led to a five-year stint in Midland, Texas, a place not known as a hotspot for things to do. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a7TcW_2b9s\">Desperate times call for desperate pleasures</a>, as Bill Ryder-Jones said, so in the land of oil, even your escapes may be related to petroleum in some way. At some point, I spent a day driving across Reagan County, starting with a town called Stiles, once the county seat until it was bypassed by the railroad and oil was discovered in Big Lake. These days little remains in Stiles, other than the remains of the former courthouse.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakelacaze.com/uploads/2021/8280b3da2a.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><small>The old Reagan County courthouse in Stiles, TX</small></p>\n\n<p>A former neighbor told me that the chainlink fence surrounding the old courthouse was erected after someone tried to burn it down a few times. I do not condone trespassing, but the fence had been cut when I visited, so I couldn&rsquo;t resist the temptation to step inside.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakelacaze.com/uploads/2021/cfb7f48fbd.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><small>Inside the courthouse</small></p>\n\n<p>Next my adventures saw me going to the settlement once called Best. I was surprised Best had a sign announcing its border, since I saw nothing else to suggest anyone ever lived within its limits. I doubt much worth remembering ever happened there since it was said that Best had the worst residents.</p>\n\n<p>The last leg of my Reagan County world tour took me to Texon, the home of the Santa Rita No. 1, the well which gave birth to decades of drilling in the Permian Basin. Aside from a monument to the well named after the patron saint of foolish endeavors&ndash;an appropriate name since crews sought oil for <em>two years</em> before finding reliable production&ndash;I saw an old scout shack with some used tires and a decaying goat.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakelacaze.com/uploads/2021/b588c6b8a5.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><small>The old scout shack in Texon, TX</small></p>\n\n<p>Each of these towns, which would be considered dead by modern measures, had its day and its history. These towns were once functioning communities with schools, banks, markets, churches, and post offices. These were places where people built lives. Places where people dreamed of a bright future. But these places in Reagan County are hardly alone, as the same goes for <a href=\"http://www.texasescapes.com/FEATURES/Thurber_Texas/Thurber_Texas_ghosttown.htm\">Thurber, Texas</a> (way over in Erath County), a former company coal mining town, which was at one time the largest settlement between Fort Worth and El Paso, and which now boasts a population of five, along with two restaurants and an old smokestack as an homage to its past. Who would have thought that the first electrified city in Texas would someday be reduced to a footnote in the history books.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakelacaze.com/uploads/2021/7c89107cf6.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><small>The lone smokestack remaining in Thurber, TX</small></p>\n\n<p>And the same goes for the Baker Hotel, located in Mineral Wells and formerly a resort for the elites who thought the town&rsquo;s spring waters had therapeutic qualities. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Hotel_(Mineral_Wells%2C_Texas)\">According to Wikipedia</a>, &ldquo;the star-studded guest list included Glenn Miller, Lawrence Welk, Clark Gable, Judy Garland, future U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, and even The Three Stooges. It is even rumored by local historians that legendary outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow may have spent a night or two at the Baker.&rdquo; An investment company had purchased the Baker and had broken ground on renovations before the pandemic, so maybe there&rsquo;s a chance that the old hotel will be once again be somewhere new memories are made.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakelacaze.com/uploads/2021/9660106f53.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><small>The Baker Hotel circa 2015</small></p>\n\n<p>At one time, people would have imagined these locations would last forever, and now these places are little more than distant memories. If such places have come and gone, why should we expect any of our comforts to be immune to such possibility? Why would we expect our jobs to be invulnerable? Our industries? Whole swaths of an economy? The pandemic has shown the flaws in many of our collective assumptions, and history echoes some of those callouts.</p>\n\n<p>More often than not, we should live through the lens of probability: <em>If x then y; what do the statistics say?</em> Yet there is utility in entertaining possibility, if only to be slightly more prepared for it. History can be a great tool for learning possibility, because while history may not repeat itself, it does often rhyme. And sometimes it features rhymes accompanied by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6rjQ9VVLDI\">808s and heartbreak</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Americans are horrible at accepting impermanence. Look no further than how hard some will fight for that extra year of life, often an extra year of pain and suffering. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhNPeiy-MeU\"><em>Life goes on long after the thrill of living is gone&hellip;</em></a></p>\n\n<p>Yet my life has improved as I&rsquo;ve learned to accept that all I hold dear will be forgotten after the earth makes a few more passes around the sun. That is more than possibility or probability. It is inevitability.</p>\n\n<p>When I visit ghost towns and abandoned places&ndash;places that once were&ndash;I can&rsquo;t help daydreaming about the stories forgotten in time. These days, I think about the stories that have been lost through those dear to me who have passed. How many stories will be lost because of my reluctance to share? These thoughts and questions, which once seemed silly, became more important once I had kids.</p>\n\n<p>I have a habit of living anywhere other than the present. I replay the past in my head and beat myself up for things I cannot change. I look ahead to catastrophes that may never materialize and work myself up over nothing. But with the help of <a href=\"https://www.wakingup.com\">meditation</a> and <a href=\"https://dailystoic.com/what-is-stoicism-a-definition-3-stoic-exercises-to-get-you-started/#what-is-stoicism\">Stoicism</a>, I&rsquo;ve become better at living in the moment, though like an addict, I relapse. Reminding myself of impermanence also helps. If precious moments are destined to be forgotten, then they should be enjoyed in their time.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;ve heard certain mantras that help to keep this in perspective for you:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nothing lasts forever.</p>\n\n<p>This too shall pass. (This mantra applies to the good times too).</p>\n\n<p>Things come, things go.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But for me, seeing is believing.</p>\n",

These days little remains in Stiles, other than the remains of the former courthouse. \n\n![](https://jakelacaze.com/uploads/2021/8280b3da2a.jpg)<small>The old Reagan County courthouse in Stiles, TX</small>\n\nA former neighbor told me that the chainlink fence surrounding the old courthouse was erected after someone tried to burn it down a few times. I do not condone trespassing, but the fence had been cut when I visited, so I couldn't resist the temptation to step inside.\n\n![](https://jakelacaze.com/uploads/2021/cfb7f48fbd.jpg)<small>Inside the courthouse</small>\n\nNext my adventures saw me going to the settlement once called Best. I was surprised Best had a sign announcing its border, since I saw nothing else to suggest anyone ever lived within its limits. I doubt much worth remembering ever happened there since it was said that Best had the worst residents.\n\nThe last leg of my Reagan County world tour took me to Texon, the home of the Santa Rita No. 1, the well which gave birth to decades of drilling in the Permian Basin. Aside from a monument to the well named after the patron saint of foolish endeavors--an appropriate name since crews sought oil for *two years* before finding reliable production--I saw an old scout shack with some used tires and a decaying goat.\n\n![](https://jakelacaze.com/uploads/2021/b588c6b8a5.jpg)<small>The old scout shack in Texon, TX</small>\n\nEach of these towns, which would be considered dead by modern measures, had its day and its history. These towns were once functioning communities with schools, banks, markets, churches, and post offices. These were places where people built lives. Places where people dreamed of a bright future. But these places in Reagan County are hardly alone, as the same goes for [Thurber, Texas](http://www.texasescapes.com/FEATURES/Thurber_Texas/Thurber_Texas_ghosttown.htm) (way over in Erath County), a former company coal mining town, which was at one time the largest settlement between Fort Worth and El Paso, and which now boasts a population of five, along with two restaurants and an old smokestack as an homage to its past. Who would have thought that the first electrified city in Texas would someday be reduced to a footnote in the history books.\n\n![](https://jakelacaze.com/uploads/2021/7c89107cf6.jpg)<small>The lone smokestack remaining in Thurber, TX</small>\n\nAnd the same goes for the Baker Hotel, located in Mineral Wells and formerly a resort for the elites who thought the town's spring waters had therapeutic qualities. [According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Hotel_(Mineral_Wells%2C_Texas)), \"the star-studded guest list included Glenn Miller, Lawrence Welk, Clark Gable, Judy Garland, future U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, and even The Three Stooges. It is even rumored by local historians that legendary outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow may have spent a night or two at the Baker.\" An investment company had purchased the Baker and had broken ground on renovations before the pandemic, so maybe there's a chance that the old hotel will be once again be somewhere new memories are made.\n\n![](https://jakelacaze.com/uploads/2021/9660106f53.jpg)<small>The Baker Hotel circa 2015</small>\n\nAt one time, people would have imagined these locations would last forever, and now these places are little more than distant memories. If such places have come and gone, why should we expect any of our comforts to be immune to such possibility? Why would we expect our jobs to be invulnerable? Our industries? Whole swaths of an economy? The pandemic has shown the flaws in many of our collective assumptions, and history echoes some of those callouts.\n\nMore often than not, we should live through the lens of probability: *If x then y; what do the statistics say?* Yet there is utility in entertaining possibility, if only to be slightly more prepared for it. History can be a great tool for learning possibility, because while history may not repeat itself, it does often rhyme. And sometimes it features rhymes accompanied by [808s and heartbreak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6rjQ9VVLDI).\n\nAmericans are horrible at accepting impermanence. Look no further than how hard some will fight for that extra year of life, often an extra year of pain and suffering. [*Life goes on long after the thrill of living is gone...*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhNPeiy-MeU)\n\nYet my life has improved as I've learned to accept that all I hold dear will be forgotten after the earth makes a few more passes around the sun. That is more than possibility or probability. It is inevitability.\n\nWhen I visit ghost towns and abandoned places--places that once were--I can't help daydreaming about the stories forgotten in time. These days, I think about the stories that have been lost through those dear to me who have passed. How many stories will be lost because of my reluctance to share? These thoughts and questions, which once seemed silly, became more important once I had kids.\n\nI have a habit of living anywhere other than the present. I replay the past in my head and beat myself up for things I cannot change. I look ahead to catastrophes that may never materialize and work myself up over nothing. But with the help of [meditation](https://www.wakingup.com) and [Stoicism](https://dailystoic.com/what-is-stoicism-a-definition-3-stoic-exercises-to-get-you-started/#what-is-stoicism), I've become better at living in the moment, though like an addict, I relapse. Reminding myself of impermanence also helps. If precious moments are destined to be forgotten, then they should be enjoyed in their time.\n\nPerhaps you've heard certain mantras that help to keep this in perspective for you:\n\n> Nothing lasts forever.\n\n> This too shall pass. (This mantra applies to the good times too).\n\n> Things come, things go.\n\nBut for me, seeing is believing. \n",

I noticed I was thanking her for every meal she prepared. She was thanking me for making coffee, a task I would have done solely for my own selfishness as I am an addict to the bean.

We all hope our current reality will be temporary, but there&rsquo;s no denying where we are in this moment.</p>\n\n<p>Take a deep breath. Cry if you need to. One more deep breath.</p>\n\n<p>Most of us now have plenty of time to contemplate our pre-quarantine lives. The weekday morning Starbucks runs. Picking up Papa John&rsquo;s simply because we don&rsquo;t feel like cooking on a Tuesday night. Going to a mall on a Sunday afternoon just to get out of the house.</p>\n\n<p>Our first reaction is likely to miss such events. But as time goes on, we may ask how much we needed those comforts, especially the longer we go without them.</p>\n\n<p>Some are making predictions for a post-quarantine world: fewer Starbucks runs, cooking at home more, and perhaps staying at home more in general. Such changes may help to lessen the shock if or when another pandemic strikes.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m interested to see how things will shake out once the world starts spinning again. What businesses will survive, and which will close their doors for good? So many on Twitter are calling for others to support local businesses as much as possible. Will this consciousness maintain once we&rsquo;ve restored and resumed our busy lives? What will the political implications be? What government restrictions will be enacted or lifted? How will this pandemic shape the conversations around universal healthcare or Universal Basic Income? Will this be the event that reunites us and brings us all back to a sensible center? Will it make us appreciate those we had come to loathe, like our libtard neighbors or our Repubtard bosses?</p>\n\n<p>So many questions. How long will we have to wait for answers? The only thing we can known for certain is that we will see consequences well beyond quarantine.</p>\n\n<p>I spent the first few days of quarantine mourning the death of my routine. I&rsquo;m still mourning.</p>\n\n<p>2019 was basically my year of building routine. A whole year examining my habits and identifying my priorities and rearranging my day and eliminating wasted activities to make time for what truly matters. I spent the first quarter of 2020 improving what I&rsquo;d built in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>And then in March all of that came to a halt as a pandemic forced us to adjust to a new normal.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t miss my morning and afternoon commutes to and from the office, but I do miss the accompanying certainty of twice a day having at least 30 minutes to listen to music or podcasts or&ndash;as I had been practicing for a couple weeks before the call for social distancing&ndash;simply driving in silence and practicing mindfulness behind the wheel.</p>\n\n<p>I miss the camaraderie with my co-workers. I miss our jokes and our banter.</p>\n\n<p>I miss going somewhere else only to quickly tire of the place and return to the comforts of home. Though an introvert and a homebody, I was always comforted in knowing that the world was there, waiting for me to join whenever I was ready.</p>\n\n<p>Before the order for social distancing, I saw routine as a necessity. But now I see that in some ways routine is a privilege. After all, to establish a routine is to assume that catastrophe will not come along and disrupt said routine. It is to assume at least a semblance of stability, something we now see none of us can take for granted.</p>\n",

One more deep breath.\n\nMost of us now have plenty of time to contemplate our pre-quarantine lives. The weekday morning Starbucks runs. Picking up Papa John's simply because we don't feel like cooking on a Tuesday night. Going to a mall on a Sunday afternoon just to get out of the house.\n\nOur first reaction is likely to miss such events. But as time goes on, we may ask how much we needed those comforts, especially the longer we go without them.\n\nSome are making predictions for a post-quarantine world: fewer Starbucks runs, cooking at home more, and perhaps staying at home more in general. Such changes may help to lessen the shock if or when another pandemic strikes.\n\nI'm interested to see how things will shake out once the world starts spinning again. What businesses will survive, and which will close their doors for good? So many on Twitter are calling for others to support local businesses as much as possible. Will this consciousness maintain once we've restored and resumed our busy lives? What will the political implications be? What government restrictions will be enacted or lifted? How will this pandemic shape the conversations around universal healthcare or Universal Basic Income? Will this be the event that reunites us and brings us all back to a sensible center? Will it make us appreciate those we had come to loathe, like our libtard neighbors or our Repubtard bosses?\n\nSo many questions. How long will we have to wait for answers? The only thing we can known for certain is that we will see consequences well beyond quarantine.\n\nI spent the first few days of quarantine mourning the death of my routine. I'm still mourning.\n\n2019 was basically my year of building routine. A whole year examining my habits and identifying my priorities and rearranging my day and eliminating wasted activities to make time for what truly matters. I spent the first quarter of 2020 improving what I'd built in 2019.\n\nAnd then in March all of that came to a halt as a pandemic forced us to adjust to a new normal.\n\nI don't miss my morning and afternoon commutes to and from the office, but I do miss the accompanying certainty of twice a day having at least 30 minutes to listen to music or podcasts or--as I had been practicing for a couple weeks before the call for social distancing--simply driving in silence and practicing mindfulness behind the wheel.\n\nI miss the camaraderie with my co-workers. I miss our jokes and our banter.\n\nI miss going somewhere else only to quickly tire of the place and return to the comforts of home. Though an introvert and a homebody, I was always comforted in knowing that the world was there, waiting for me to join whenever I was ready.\n\nBefore the order for social distancing, I saw routine as a necessity. But now I see that in some ways routine is a privilege. After all, to establish a routine is to assume that catastrophe will not come along and disrupt said routine. It is to assume at least a semblance of stability, something we now see none of us can take for granted.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I spend so much time trying to get out of my head yet I&rsquo;ve spent the last few weeks trying to get back in. The holiday season beginning with Thanksgiving disrupted the routine I had spent most of 2019 creating. One of my proudest accomplishments of the year was negated by a few days off work. 2019 was the year I realized the importance of consistency. And 2020 will by the year I focus on regaining and maintaining consistency while preparing for the disruption that will come with the 2020 holiday season.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for my ideal balance&ndash;yes, even when I walk because I can be clumsy at times&ndash;and part of that quest includes establishing how much time to spend in my own head. Spending too much time in your own mental juggle has negatives. For instance, when you&rsquo;re feeling stress or self-doubt during tense competition, it&rsquo;s probably best to break out of the gauntlet of your mind.</p>\n\n<p>In the long run, listening to your internal negative voices may reveal problems you need to address, but if time is valuable and a deadline is looming, those voices will likely weigh you down and so they should be ignored until a later date. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUnXxh5U25Y\">Everything in its right place.</a></p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve grown up living in my own head. Doing so has always felt natural. Perhaps the comfort stems from growing up an only child. As an only child, I have no problem entertaining myself since I&rsquo;m used to having no one else around to entertain me. In fact, these days when free time is ever more precious, I often prefer to be left to my own devices. I enjoy doing what I want to do and pursuing my interests. I&rsquo;m self-sufficient that way.</p>\n\n<p>Like any other introvert, I explore the world while in my head. Sometimes I start with a random thought which leads to an hours-long daydream. The origins of my blog posts and fiction exist in the real world outside my head, but the heart of my writing is discovered in my thoughts. If I don&rsquo;t have time alone to consider all that&rsquo;s happening around me, I will never be able to write. And worse, I will feel as I am just bouncing around in life with no direction.</p>\n\n<p>I need to be inside my own head in order to process the world around me and believe me, I have quite a bit to process. Also, I&rsquo;m not remarkably intelligent, so I need time to repeatedly attack my challenges. But emotions in particular take much effort to sort through and make sense of.</p>\n\n<p>In numerous previous posts I&rsquo;ve shared <a href=\"/untold-truths-about-loss-and-grief\">my struggles with processing grief</a>. And as I‚Äôve said on previous posts, grief can be complicated and tricky. But the same can be said about anger. The root of anger is not always obvious and can take some time to discover. Perhaps that&rsquo;s because <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shrink-in-the-kitchen/201506/anger-is-energy\">anger is a reaction more than an emotion</a>. Regardless, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPj-8_wOZcA\">anger is an energy</a>, one that should be managed.</p>\n\n<p>When you spend time in your head, it&rsquo;s too easy to see your own perspective. I&rsquo;m wise enough to know that I am wrong plenty. On the flip side, I have had a habit of ignoring my feelings in order to keep peace with others, a practice which caused me to become angry and unhappy with myself. Ignoring your own emotions is not a great way to keep peace within yourself. Now when I am angry, not only do I search for the origin of my anger, but I then have to judge whether said anger is justified or I have to ask to what extent it is justified. Anger has a way of clouding anyone&rsquo;s vision, so these situations can take a while as I work to determine what I should apologize for and what I should stand firm on.</p>\n\n<p>Few people see the world as I do, and only I see it exactly as I do.  That&rsquo;s why I treasure those few people I can connect with about my passions. Those people allow me to share what&rsquo;s in my head&ndash;my true self&ndash;and in those moments I feel comfortable stepping outside of myself.</p>\n\n<p>The struggle with how much to live inside your head plays into the balance of conformity vs. individuality. To function in society, we all have to conform to some extent. We have to create a sense of familiarity with others to earn the benefits and protections of belonging to a larger group. But we do have to stay true to ourselves about what we value and hold dear. You can run all you want, but you can&rsquo;t hide from yourself&ndash;at least not without the assistance of mind-altering drugs. <em>Wherever you go, there you are.</em></p>\n\n<p>As I now find comfort in settling back into my own head, I know it‚Äôs only a matter of time before I‚Äôll be fighting to get out again as part of my endless labor to find and maintain balance while I ping-pong between the poles. Such is life.</p>\n",

And 2020 will by the year I focus on regaining and maintaining consistency while preparing for the disruption that will come with the 2020 holiday season.\n\nI'm always looking for my ideal balance--yes, even when I walk because I can be clumsy at times--and part of that quest includes establishing how much time to spend in my own head. Spending too much time in your own mental juggle has negatives. For instance, when you're feeling stress or self-doubt during tense competition, it's probably best to break out of the gauntlet of your mind.\n\nIn the long run, listening to your internal negative voices may reveal problems you need to address, but if time is valuable and a deadline is looming, those voices will likely weigh you down and so they should be ignored until a later date. [Everything in its right place.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUnXxh5U25Y)\n\nI've grown up living in my own head. Doing so has always felt natural. Perhaps the comfort stems from growing up an only child. As an only child, I have no problem entertaining myself since I'm used to having no one else around to entertain me. In fact, these days when free time is ever more precious, I often prefer to be left to my own devices. I enjoy doing what I want to do and pursuing my interests. I'm self-sufficient that way.\n\nLike any other introvert, I explore the world while in my head. Sometimes I start with a random thought which leads to an hours-long daydream. The origins of my blog posts and fiction exist in the real world outside my head, but the heart of my writing is discovered in my thoughts. If I don't have time alone to consider all that's happening around me, I will never be able to write. And worse, I will feel as I am just bouncing around in life with no direction.\n\nI need to be inside my own head in order to process the world around me and believe me, I have quite a bit to process. Also, I'm not remarkably intelligent, so I need time to repeatedly attack my challenges. But emotions in particular take much effort to sort through and make sense of.\n\nIn numerous previous posts I've shared [my struggles with processing grief](/untold-truths-about-loss-and-grief). And as I‚Äôve said on previous posts, grief can be complicated and tricky. But the same can be said about anger. The root of anger is not always obvious and can take some time to discover. Perhaps that's because [anger is a reaction more than an emotion](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shrink-in-the-kitchen/201506/anger-is-energy). Regardless, [anger is an energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPj-8_wOZcA), one that should be managed.\n\nWhen you spend time in your head, it's too easy to see your own perspective. I'm wise enough to know that I am wrong plenty. On the flip side, I have had a habit of ignoring my feelings in order to keep peace with others, a practice which caused me to become angry and unhappy with myself. Ignoring your own emotions is not a great way to keep peace within yourself. Now when I am angry, not only do I search for the origin of my anger, but I then have to judge whether said anger is justified or I have to ask to what extent it is justified. Anger has a way of clouding anyone's vision, so these situations can take a while as I work to determine what I should apologize for and what I should stand firm on.\n\nFew people see the world as I do, and only I see it exactly as I do.  That's why I treasure those few people I can connect with about my passions. Those people allow me to share what's in my head--my true self--and in those moments I feel comfortable stepping outside of myself.\n\nThe struggle with how much to live inside your head plays into the balance of conformity vs. individuality. To function in society, we all have to conform to some extent. We have to create a sense of familiarity with others to earn the benefits and protections of belonging to a larger group. But we do have to stay true to ourselves about what we value and hold dear. You can run all you want, but you can't hide from yourself--at least not without the assistance of mind-altering drugs. *Wherever you go, there you are.*\n\nAs I now find comfort in settling back into my own head, I know it‚Äôs only a matter of time before I‚Äôll be fighting to get out again as part of my endless labor to find and maintain balance while I ping-pong between the poles. Such is life.\n",

				"content_html": "\n\n<p>These days Thanksgiving, once my undisputed favorite holiday, is a bittersweet experience. But this holiday will likely have extra bitterness as the day marks the eighth anniversary of my mother&rsquo;s death.</p>\n\n<p>Before November 28, 2011, Thanksgiving was simple, and simplicity was what I loved about it. Thanksgiving was a day spent with family as we stuffed our faces with food all day. Maybe we turned on the football game or maybe my aunt insisted that we watch the Macy&rsquo;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. We would give in on my aunt&rsquo;s demand because refusal meant she was going to suggest for the umpteen thousandth time that we watch The Last Of The Mohicans, a request which became the subject of jokes at our family gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>My family&rsquo;s Thanksgiving affairs were small, usually ranging somewhere between four and eight attendees, depending on where family feuds stood and which cousins could attend on any given year.</p>\n\n<p>My grandmother prepared the bulk of our Thanksgiving meals. She was a cook on a tugboat, so she was what you might call <em>a professional</em>. She took her craft seriously, which I realized when one day she snapped at me for teasing that her mashed potatoes were a little too lumpy. I was too young and ignorant to understand how deeply I had cut her as I questioned her competence in her life&rsquo;s work.</p>\n\n<p>Our meals were traditional Southern Thanksgiving cuisine: turkey, dressing, mashed potatoes and gravy, cranberry sauce, steamed broccoli, creamed corn, dinner rolls&ndash;all of it amazing but undoubtedly unhealthy due to my grandmother&rsquo;s liberal use of butter and lard whenever possible.</p>\n\n<p>Lunch was just the beginning. My grandmother would make an abundance of desserts, usually an assortment of pies. Pumpkin pie. Apple pie. Pecan pie. But the winner was always my mother&rsquo;s cherry cream cheese pies. No one else could make these pies like my mother could. I know because one year my grandmother tried, only to take a hit to her ego as my cousins and I ate her pies without our usual enthuasism for my mother&rsquo;s offerings. We didn&rsquo;t want to hurt our grandmother&rsquo;s feelings, but we could not deny that my mother made the superior pie.</p>\n\n<p>We couldn&rsquo;t put our fingers on why, but my grandmother&rsquo;s attempt tasted different. A subtle difference elevated my mother&rsquo;s pies to a higher plain. After a brief discusission between the two culinary wizards, we solved the mystery. For years my mother had forgotten to include vanilla extract in her pies&rsquo; ingredients. The recipe would argue that she had been making these pies wrong all this time, but the rest of the family would argue that she had been making them <em>just right</em>.</p>\n\n<p>We would spend the rest of the day picking on leftovers, having second lunch around 3PM and then having dinner at 6. And when we left, we would argue with my grandmother over how much food we were going to take home. My grandmother always wanted to send us off with way too much, but I can&rsquo;t blame her because she was the only one at her home around to eat anything left behind. Her best chance for getting rid of her leftovers was to invite us over for lunch over the next few days and we would sit around and reminisce about Thanksgiving and tell my grandmother once again how good the whole meal was.</p>\n\n<p>Except for the cherry cream cheese pies. We maneuvered around the topic, as if the event never happened. In every category outside of desserts, my grandmother had <em>won</em> Thanksgiving, but her sole defeat overshadowed her numerous victories.</p>\n\n<p>Thanksgiving 2011 was the last holiday I spent with my mother. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t as joyful a time as Thanksgivings past. At that point, my mother was confined to a hospice bed in the living room. I don&rsquo;t remember much from the holiday other than her condition. I have no idea what we ate. Did we even have a Thanksgiving meal?</p>\n\n<p>An aunt&ndash;my dad&rsquo;s sister who lived an hour or so away&ndash;was having an after-Thanksgiving get together at her house the following Saturday. It seeemed appropriate to go since my dad had passed away six weeks before.</p>\n\n<p>When I left for my aunt&rsquo;s house, I didn&rsquo;t know that I would never see my mother conscious again. But I can&rsquo;t help wondering if she knew because in hindsight, I can&rsquo;t help thinking that she didn&rsquo;t want me to go.</p>\n\n<p>My mother didn&rsquo;t seem enthuasistic about my leaving, but she might have been exhausted as her seven-month battle with lung cancer was coming to a close. The cancer had widdled her down to a figure of little more than flesh and bone, unable to walk to the front door without making multiple stops to catch her breath. Chemotherapy no longer an option, a steady IV drip of morphine had become her only relief. Maybe she was just tired. It can&rsquo;t all be about me, after all.</p>\n\n<p>My aunt&rsquo;s get together was fine until I received a call from my stepfather saying that my mother&rsquo;s condition appeared to be going downhill fast and that I should come home. Once I had returned, my mother had lost consciousness, and we spent the rest of the day watching her, hanging on every labored breath, silently wondering if each one would be her last.</p>\n\n<p>The next day I left to go back to Texas. Part of me said that this was the end and that I should stay, but so many times I had left convinced I had seen her for the last time. Just four months before, my mother had had an incident in which she was pronounced dead in the hosptial before somehow coming back to life without resucitation. After my mother&rsquo;s resurrection, everyone was convinced that she wouldn&rsquo;t survive the weekend. Yet after a couple of months she started looking better, almost as if the cancer was reversing. But these bouncebacks happen with cancer, and the optimism was short-lived.</p>\n\n<p>Back in Texas, sometime in the early morning of November 28, 2011, I received the phone call from my stepdad telling me that my mother had passed away.</p>\n\n<p>And so now, regardless of the specific date of Thanksgiving, I will always associate the holiday with her death. But that doesn&rsquo;t have to be a bad thing. As I said earlier, the holiday is now bittersweet for me, and now I would like to move on from the bitter and focus on the sweet.</p>\n\n<p>A common practice among bloggers on Thanksgiving is to write a post about what one is thankful or grateful for. I want to put my spin on it and talk about what I&rsquo;m thankful for as related to the loss of my mother.</p>\n\n<p>So let&rsquo;s get to the point. This Thanksgiving I&rsquo;m thankful for:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"26-years-with-my-mother\">26 years with my mother</h2>\n\n<p>I was 26 years old when my mother died. Not only was my mother taken far too early for her sake&ndash;she was only 51 years old&ndash;but she was taken far too early for my sake. I wasn&rsquo;t prepared to lose my mother. Is anyone really ever prepared for such an event? While I can mope and pity myself endlessly, I have to acknowledge that some people lose their parents much earlier. As tough as it was to become motherless at 26 years old, I shudder when I imagine what might have happened if I had lost her any sooner.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"my-mother-s-support-of-my-independence\">My mother&rsquo;s support of my independence</h2>\n\n<p>If I could give my mother credit for <em>only one thing</em> that contributed to my success, I would give her credit for pushing me forward and never holding me back. I can think of a couple of conversations to illustrate my point.</p>\n\n<p>The first conversation went something like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mother: You don&rsquo;t like it here, do you?\nMe: No.\nMother: You want out, don&rsquo;t you?\nMe: Yes.\nMother: Then you need to go to college.\nMe: Okay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Such conversations pushed me out into the world and ensured that I would embrace the uncertainty of new opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>The second conversation took place over the phone shortly after I had gotten laid off from my first real job during the Great Recession. At some point, my mom said, &ldquo;You know you can&rsquo;t come home, right?&rdquo; 10-4, Mother. No safety net from you. Gotcha. But her line was deeper than that. She and I agreed there was no opportunity in my hometown, so coming home would have been the dumbest thing I could have done.</p>\n\n<p>Or maybe Mom was enjoying having an empty nest. Who knows. Either way, she always insisted that I move forward and she never guilted me into staying put. I&rsquo;m so much more thankful for the encouragement now that she&rsquo;s gone. What if I had stayed behind for her, only to have her leave me so soon?</p>\n\n<p>We often hear that dying people will share their biggest regrets with others. One day my mother shared with me her regret she hadn&rsquo;t left my hometown when she had had chances. But she had gotten comfortable in her discontent. I&rsquo;m thankful my mother did not allow me to fall into the same trap.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"my-mother-never-told-me-what-to-think\">My mother never told me what to think</h2>\n\n<p>I can&rsquo;t remember a time when my mother ever shut me down whenever I shared an opinion. If my mother disagreed or was unfamiliar with my stance, she asked questions and allowed me to elaborate my points. Maybe that&rsquo;s why I now speak as if anyone would ever give a damn about my thoughts. Or maybe it&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve started blogging again&ndash;maybe I&rsquo;m seeking to replace the lost maternal audience.</p>\n\n<p>I try to pay forward my mother&rsquo;s courtesy while also being true to myself by being honest about my disagreements. If the masses would adopt this habit from my mother, the world would be a much better place.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"for-the-lessons-from-the-grief\">For the lessons from the grief</h2>\n\n<p>When something traumatic happens to you, you have to find a way to see the positives. Is doing so desperate? Are you deluding yourself into feeling better about the situation? One could make these arguments, but I would argue that finding the positives is crucial to allowing trauma to become a catalyst of growth rather than a consistent harbinger of pain and despair.</p>\n\n<p>I am a better person because of my experiences with loss, grief, and depression. I am better able to assist others because I have navigated my way through my own personal hell. Does that mean I&rsquo;m glad my mother and others have passed away? Of course not. But finding a positive spin has allowed me to find fulfillment after the chaos, and so my grief doesn&rsquo;t own me anymore. I own my grief. I can&rsquo;t control it, but I have learned to flow with it, how to enjoy the ride. And I am still learning how to make my experiences a tool that can help others.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"for-showing-me-i-can-be-critical-while-continuing-to-accept-someone-i-love\">For showing me I can be critical while continuing to accept someone I love</h2>\n\n<p>To this point, I&rsquo;ve painted only the rosiest picture of my mother, but as is usually the case with those we love, she wasn&rsquo;t perfect. Below are a couple of shortcomings:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"reclusiveness\">Reclusiveness</h3>\n\n<p>If my mother wasn&rsquo;t at work, she was likely at home. The only person she visited on a regular basis was her own mother. My mother&rsquo;s reclusiveness was partially justified by the fact that before my stepfather came along, she was a single working mother. She was often tired, so staying home was the easy thing to do. But in reality, my mother also did not want to be a burden to others, so she robbed others of the chance of ever becoming closer to her. And I missed out on some important social skills, but don&rsquo;t worry, Ma&ndash;I&rsquo;m improving every day.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"stubbornness\">Stubbornness</h3>\n\n<p>At times my mother could dig her heels in to make someone else&rsquo;s life hell. My mother is the only person I know to be written up at work for refusing to take vacation. At one time, my mother&rsquo;s employer compensated employees for any unused vacation time. My mother looked forward to these unofficial bonus checks at the end of the year when she would effectively cash in her vacation time. As a cost-cutting measure, the company required employees to take their vacation and no longer allowed employees to be paid for the unused time. My mother decided to keep it real and show them that she was going to get her money for her unused vacation time. The company kept it realer and slapped her with an offense.</p>\n\n<p>I could find plenty of other things to criticize my mother about, but that&rsquo;s not the point. Instead, the point is that criticism is not always rejection. And I&rsquo;m not sure if you can ever truly love someone if you can&rsquo;t acknowledge the person&rsquo;s flaws. But my mother&rsquo;s good certainly outweighed her bad, and for that I am also thankful.</p>\n\n<p>My mother won&rsquo;t be present this Thanksgiving, just as she hasn&rsquo;t been present for the last seven holidays and as she won&rsquo;t be present for any number of holidays that follow. Her absence haunts me daily and I&rsquo;ll never get over the loss. But the good news is that other peope will be present on November 28, 2019. Maybe too many people. Last I heard, the headcount is expected to be 25 people. My anxiety is kicking in already.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m expecting a day full of love and good food. I&rsquo;m lucky to have this opportunity, and for that I am thankful. I hope everyone reading this is able to spend Thanksgiving (and every day for that manner) with those they love. I hope you&rsquo;re able to make great memories that will stay with you after your loved ones are gone. Not just gone in the sense of death. Maybe a sibling goes off to college. Or a child moves away and starts a new life in some exciting new city in a different time zone and neglects to check in as often as you would like.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever the specifics, the point remains: These comforts won&rsquo;t last forever, which is why we should enjoy them as much as we can whenever we can.</p>\n\n<p>And if you have stuck around and have read this far, I&rsquo;m thankful to you and for you.</p>\n\n<p>Happy Thanksgiving</p>\n",

My grandmother would make an abundance of desserts, usually an assortment of pies. Pumpkin pie. Apple pie. Pecan pie. But the winner was always my mother's cherry cream cheese pies. No one else could make these pies like my mother could. I know because one year my grandmother tried, only to take a hit to her ego as my cousins and I ate her pies without our usual enthuasism for my mother's offerings. We didn't want to hurt our grandmother's feelings, but we could not deny that my mother made the superior pie.\n\nWe couldn't put our fingers on why, but my grandmother's attempt tasted different. A subtle difference elevated my mother's pies to a higher plain. After a brief discusission between the two culinary wizards, we solved the mystery. For years my mother had forgotten to include vanilla extract in her pies' ingredients. The recipe would argue that she had been making these pies wrong all this time, but the rest of the family would argue that she had been making them *just right*.\n\nWe would spend the rest of the day picking on leftovers, having second lunch around 3PM and then having dinner at 6. And when we left, we would argue with my grandmother over how much food we were going to take home. My grandmother always wanted to send us off with way too much, but I can't blame her because she was the only one at her home around to eat anything left behind. Her best chance for getting rid of her leftovers was to invite us over for lunch over the next few days and we would sit around and reminisce about Thanksgiving and tell my grandmother once again how good the whole meal was.\n\nExcept for the cherry cream cheese pies. We maneuvered around the topic, as if the event never happened. In every category outside of desserts, my grandmother had *won* Thanksgiving, but her sole defeat overshadowed her numerous victories.\n\nThanksgiving 2011 was the last holiday I spent with my mother. Unfortunately, it wasn't as joyful a time as Thanksgivings past. At that point, my mother was confined to a hospice bed in the living room. I don't remember much from the holiday other than her condition. I have no idea what we ate. Did we even have a Thanksgiving meal? \n\nAn aunt--my dad's sister who lived an hour or so away--was having an after-Thanksgiving get together at her house the following Saturday. It seeemed appropriate to go since my dad had passed away six weeks before. \n\nWhen I left for my aunt's house, I didn't know that I would never see my mother conscious again. But I can't help wondering if she knew because in hindsight, I can't help thinking that she didn't want me to go. \n\nMy mother didn't seem enthuasistic about my leaving, but she might have been exhausted as her seven-month battle with lung cancer was coming to a close. The cancer had widdled her down to a figure of little more than flesh and bone, unable to walk to the front door without making multiple stops to catch her breath. Chemotherapy no longer an option, a steady IV drip of morphine had become her only relief. Maybe she was just tired. It can't all be about me, after all.\n\nMy aunt's get together was fine until I received a call from my stepfather saying that my mother's condition appeared to be going downhill fast and that I should come home. Once I had returned, my mother had lost consciousness, and we spent the rest of the day watching her, hanging on every labored breath, silently wondering if each one would be her last. \n\nThe next day I left to go back to Texas. Part of me said that this was the end and that I should stay, but so many times I had left convinced I had seen her for the last time. Just four months before, my mother had had an incident in which she was pronounced dead in the hosptial before somehow coming back to life without resucitation. After my mother's resurrection, everyone was convinced that she wouldn't survive the weekend. Yet after a couple of months she started looking better, almost as if the cancer was reversing. But these bouncebacks happen with cancer, and the optimism was short-lived.\n\nBack in Texas, sometime in the early morning of November 28, 2011, I received the phone call from my stepdad telling me that my mother had passed away.\n\nAnd so now, regardless of the specific date of Thanksgiving, I will always associate the holiday with her death. But that doesn't have to be a bad thing. As I said earlier, the holiday is now bittersweet for me, and now I would like to move on from the bitter and focus on the sweet.\n\nA common practice among bloggers on Thanksgiving is to write a post about what one is thankful or grateful for. I want to put my spin on it and talk about what I'm thankful for as related to the loss of my mother.\n\nSo let's get to the point. This Thanksgiving I'm thankful for:\n\n## 26 years with my mother\n\nI was 26 years old when my mother died. Not only was my mother taken far too early for her sake--she was only 51 years old--but she was taken far too early for my sake. I wasn't prepared to lose my mother. Is anyone really ever prepared for such an event? While I can mope and pity myself endlessly, I have to acknowledge that some people lose their parents much earlier. As tough as it was to become motherless at 26 years old, I shudder when I imagine what might have happened if I had lost her any sooner.\n\n## My mother's support of my independence\n\nIf I could give my mother credit for *only one thing* that contributed to my success, I would give her credit for pushing me forward and never holding me back. I can think of a couple of conversations to illustrate my point.\n\nThe first conversation went something like this:\n\n>Mother: You don't like it here, do you?\nMe: No.\nMother: You want out, don't you?\nMe: Yes.\nMother: Then you need to go to college.\nMe: Okay.\n\nSuch conversations pushed me out into the world and ensured that I would embrace the uncertainty of new opportunities.\n\nThe second conversation took place over the phone shortly after I had gotten laid off from my first real job during the Great Recession. At some point, my mom said, \"You know you can't come home, right?\" 10-4, Mother. No safety net from you. Gotcha. But her line was deeper than that. She and I agreed there was no opportunity in my hometown, so coming home would have been the dumbest thing I could have done.\n\nOr maybe Mom was enjoying having an empty nest. Who knows. Either way, she always insisted that I move forward and she never guilted me into staying put. I'm so much more thankful for the encouragement now that she's gone. What if I had stayed behind for her, only to have her leave me so soon? \n\nWe often hear that dying people will share their biggest regrets with others. One day my mother shared with me her regret she hadn't left my hometown when she had had chances. But she had gotten comfortable in her discontent. I'm thankful my mother did not allow me to fall into the same trap.\n\n## My mother never told me what to think\n\nI can't remember a time when my mother ever shut me down whenever I shared an opinion. If my mother disagreed or was unfamiliar with my stance, she asked questions and allowed me to elaborate my points. Maybe that's why I now speak as if anyone would ever give a damn about my thoughts. Or maybe it's why I've started blogging again--maybe I'm seeking to replace the lost maternal audience.\n\nI try to pay forward my mother's courtesy while also being true to myself by being honest about my disagreements. If the masses would adopt this habit from my mother, the world would be a much better place.\n\n## For the lessons from the grief\n\nWhen something traumatic happens to you, you have to find a way to see the positives. Is doing so desperate? Are you deluding yourself into feeling better about the situation? One could make these arguments, but I would argue that finding the positives is crucial to allowing trauma to become a catalyst of growth rather than a consistent harbinger of pain and despair.\n\nI am a better person because of my experiences with loss, grief, and depression. I am better able to assist others because I have navigated my way through my own personal hell. Does that mean I'm glad my mother and others have passed away? Of course not. But finding a positive spin has allowed me to find fulfillment after the chaos, and so my grief doesn't own me anymore. I own my grief. I can't control it, but I have learned to flow with it, how to enjoy the ride. And I am still learning how to make my experiences a tool that can help others.\n\n## For showing me I can be critical while continuing to accept someone I love\n\nTo this point, I've painted only the rosiest picture of my mother, but as is usually the case with those we love, she wasn't perfect. Below are a couple of shortcomings:\n\n### Reclusiveness\n\nIf my mother wasn't at work, she was likely at home. The only person she visited on a regular basis was her own mother. My mother's reclusiveness was partially justified by the fact that before my stepfather came along, she was a single working mother. She was often tired, so staying home was the easy thing to do. But in reality, my mother also did not want to be a burden to others, so she robbed others of the chance of ever becoming closer to her. And I missed out on some important social skills, but don't worry, Ma--I'm improving every day.\n\n### Stubbornness\n\nAt times my mother could dig her heels in to make someone else's life hell. My mother is the only person I know to be written up at work for refusing to take vacation. At one time, my mother's employer compensated employees for any unused vacation time. My mother looked forward to these unofficial bonus checks at the end of the year when she would effectively cash in her vacation time. As a cost-cutting measure, the company required employees to take their vacation and no longer allowed employees to be paid for the unused time. My mother decided to keep it real and show them that she was going to get her money for her unused vacation time. The company kept it realer and slapped her with an offense.\n\nI could find plenty of other things to criticize my mother about, but that's not the point. Instead, the point is that criticism is not always rejection. And I'm not sure if you can ever truly love someone if you can't acknowledge the person's flaws. But my mother's good certainly outweighed her bad, and for that I am also thankful.\n\nMy mother won't be present this Thanksgiving, just as she hasn't been present for the last seven holidays and as she won't be present for any number of holidays that follow. Her absence haunts me daily and I'll never get over the loss. But the good news is that other peope will be present on November 28, 2019. Maybe too many people. Last I heard, the headcount is expected to be 25 people. My anxiety is kicking in already.\n\nI'm expecting a day full of love and good food. I'm lucky to have this opportunity, and for that I am thankful. I hope everyone reading this is able to spend Thanksgiving (and every day for that manner) with those they love. I hope you're able to make great memories that will stay with you after your loved ones are gone. Not just gone in the sense of death. Maybe a sibling goes off to college. Or a child moves away and starts a new life in some exciting new city in a different time zone and neglects to check in as often as you would like.\n\nWhatever the specifics, the point remains: These comforts won't last forever, which is why we should enjoy them as much as we can whenever we can.\n\nAnd if you have stuck around and have read this far, I'm thankful to you and for you.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving\n",

				"content_html": "<p>While I am in some ways intrigued by Gary Vaynerchuk, I am wary of his advice. In particular, I do not like Vaynerchuk&rsquo;s message of working every second of every day in order to achieve success. While I do believe that hard work and sacrifice are important, I do worry about the effects a relentless grind has on one&rsquo;s physical and mental health. Fortunately, <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/michael-schein/why-gary-vaynerchuk-is-flat-out-wrong.html\">it appears that I&rsquo;m not alone</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, I do believe in giving credit where it&rsquo;s due. And though I disagree with his overall message, that hardly means Vaynerchuk has no good insights. After all, even a broken clock is right twice a day.</p>\n\n<p>Despite my concerns about Vaynerchuk, I have been hearing echoes of one piece of his advice in my own life over the last few weeks:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Love the process and the grind more than the payoff.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Allow me to share a couple of anecdotes to elaborate.</p>\n\n<p>I recently attended a writer&rsquo;s happy hour. At a hip coffee shop in Dallas&rsquo;s Bishop Arts district, I spent a significant portion of the night talking to the one non-writer who decided to accompany her husband to the event. At one point, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1iQp8g9SQo\">my single-serving friend</a> asked what I was looking to accomplish with my writing.</p>\n\n<p>I felt as if she was expecting a grandiose answer. Was I hoping to write a novel that would be published by one of the big dogs? Was I hoping to write the next hot series that everyone wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get enough of?</p>\n\n<p>While either of those scenarios would be awesome, I&rsquo;d be lying if I said they were my primary aim at the moment, so I gave what was likely the <em>most uncoolest</em> answer I could have given. I told her that I was simply focused on establishing the habit of writing.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, I have dreams of achieving some form of writing success. I would love it if I were able to build a following on this blog. Maybe one day I will actually write a bestselling novel or memoir. Or who knows, maybe I will be invited onto some morning TV show to discuss the triviality of the semicolon. (For the record, I see such usage as a personal choice; do what feels right.)</p>\n\n<p>But these goals and dreams mean nothing if I don&rsquo;t actually write and subscribe to the process. None of my writing goals will ever be realized without the proper set of actions.</p>\n\n<p>In a previous post, I revealed <a href=\"/new-at-getting-old\">how starting the habit of exercising nearly killed me</a>. But in that post I didn&rsquo;t mention that I&rsquo;ve lost 15 pounds in the last four months. Recently, too few of my co-workers opted to participate in a workout session, so it had to be cancelled.</p>\n\n<p>I was genuinely upset. My process had been disrupted, and now I was going to have to make up for the missed workout later on in the week.</p>\n\n<p>So many of us want to lose weight, and we all know what we need to do. No fad diets, no gimmicks. Just good old fashioned diet and exercise. Burn more calories than you consume. It&rsquo;s simple math.</p>\n\n<p>Often it&rsquo;s not a lack of knowledge that keeps us from reaching our goals, especially in the age of the internet, where the answers to our curiosities are only a Google search away. It&rsquo;s our unwillingness to embrace the process that holds us back.</p>\n\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t start losing weight because I made it a goal. I started losing weight because I built a process. In addition to the weekly workouts at the office, I also go for walks and jogs at least three times a week. I am more mindful of what I eat and try not to go overboard with the sweets and carbs. The thing about processes is that they can almost always be improved in some way. In this case, the diet portion of my process could certainly use some work.</p>\n\n<p>Goals are good and often necessary, but they are not the most crucial ingredient for success.

				"content_text": "While I am in some ways intrigued by Gary Vaynerchuk, I am wary of his advice. In particular, I do not like Vaynerchuk's message of working every second of every day in order to achieve success. While I do believe that hard work and sacrifice are important, I do worry about the effects a relentless grind has on one's physical and mental health. Fortunately, [it appears that I'm not alone](https://www.inc.com/michael-schein/why-gary-vaynerchuk-is-flat-out-wrong.html). \n\nHowever, I do believe in giving credit where it's due. And though I disagree with his overall message, that hardly means Vaynerchuk has no good insights. After all, even a broken clock is right twice a day.\n\nDespite my concerns about Vaynerchuk, I have been hearing echoes of one piece of his advice in my own life over the last few weeks:\n\n> \"Love the process and the grind more than the payoff.\"\n\n\nAllow me to share a couple of anecdotes to elaborate.\n\nI recently attended a writer's happy hour. At a hip coffee shop in Dallas's Bishop Arts district, I spent a significant portion of the night talking to the one non-writer who decided to accompany her husband to the event. At one point, [my single-serving friend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1iQp8g9SQo) asked what I was looking to accomplish with my writing. \n\nI felt as if she was expecting a grandiose answer. Was I hoping to write a novel that would be published by one of the big dogs? Was I hoping to write the next hot series that everyone wouldn't be able to get enough of?\n\nWhile either of those scenarios would be awesome, I'd be lying if I said they were my primary aim at the moment, so I gave what was likely the *most uncoolest* answer I could have given. I told her that I was simply focused on establishing the habit of writing.\n\nSure, I have dreams of achieving some form of writing success. I would love it if I were able to build a following on this blog. Maybe one day I will actually write a bestselling novel or memoir. Or who knows, maybe I will be invited onto some morning TV show to discuss the triviality of the semicolon. (For the record, I see such usage as a personal choice; do what feels right.)\n\nBut these goals and dreams mean nothing if I don't actually write and subscribe to the process. None of my writing goals will ever be realized without the proper set of actions.\n\nIn a previous post, I revealed [how starting the habit of exercising nearly killed me](/new-at-getting-old). But in that post I didn't mention that I've lost 15 pounds in the last four months. Recently, too few of my co-workers opted to participate in a workout session, so it had to be cancelled. \n\nI was genuinely upset. My process had been disrupted, and now I was going to have to make up for the missed workout later on in the week. \n\nSo many of us want to lose weight, and we all know what we need to do. No fad diets, no gimmicks. Just good old fashioned diet and exercise. Burn more calories than you consume. It's simple math.\n\nOften it's not a lack of knowledge that keeps us from reaching our goals, especially in the age of the internet, where the answers to our curiosities are only a Google search away. It's our unwillingness to embrace the process that holds us back.\n\nI didn't start losing weight because I made it a goal. I started losing weight because I built a process. In addition to the weekly workouts at the office, I also go for walks and jogs at least three times a week. I am more mindful of what I eat and try not to go overboard with the sweets and carbs. The thing about processes is that they can almost always be improved in some way. In this case, the diet portion of my process could certainly use some work.\n\nGoals are good and often necessary, but they are not the most crucial ingredient for success. Good processes and commitment to those processes are far more important. If you want to get somewhere, you have to get moving. And once you get moving, you may find that you change paths and goals at some point. Maybe where you were originally headed has too many roadblocks, or maybe you found a more interesting destination. But you are unlikely to get anywhere standing still.\n\nIt's so easy to fall in love with the stories of people who were discovered without even trying.

As Seth Godin has said, \"[No one's coming. Stop waiting to get picked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO-hnbbK_lc)\".\n\nI'm not sure what I ultimately hope to accomplish with my writing.

				"title": "Questions of Online Identity",
				"content_html": "<p>The concept of identity is a significant struggle for nearly everyone. For most, the struggle has begun by adolescence, when we find ourselves juggling hormones and free thought and free will. This struggle evolves and continues or resurfaces throughout various points of a lifetime: the first time we leave the family nest, the mid-life crisis, and then our turn as empty nesters, just to name a few.</p>\n\n<p>In order to satisfy the search for our own identities, we have to answer numerous questions about ourselves. Questions of ideology, ethics, morality, sexuality and perhaps even gender. We have to consider how we present ourselves, whom we associate with, and how we respond to offenses both direct and indirect. Every bit of nuance goes into defining an identity. Or perhaps I should say <em>identities</em>, as most of us do conduct ourselves differently depending on our audience or company. Most of us do not act the same at work vs. at home or among friends vs. among family. We acknowledge and accept that different scenarios call for different behavior norms. Some would call this being two-faced as if it is merely a character flaw, but I&rsquo;m sure there is some evolutionary benefit to such behavior. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-likability-matters-more-at-work-1395788402\">Likability does have its perks</a>, after all.</p>\n\n<p>I try to keep my multiple selves as consistent as possible, but there&rsquo;s no denying that I&rsquo;m different people in different contexts. My opinions are quite different if a microphone is in my face as opposed to what I will say among trusted friends or under the guise of anonymity or a pseudonym.</p>\n\n<p>Exactly what or how much is crucial to an individual&rsquo;s identity? What is included and packaged into the whole deal? Our awards and accomplishments? Our voting records? Our charitable causes? The lines are not always so clear.</p>\n\n<p>Even corporations struggle with these questions. Should a corporation just operate within the lens of its industry, or is it required to stand for something outside of its core business? Let&rsquo;s be honest and state the obvious&ndash;corporations are purely profit-driven. I do not fault them for that. But since the pursuit of profit is the primary identity of a corporation, I&rsquo;m usually suspicious whenever a corporation champions a cause. However, the courts have ruled that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2014/07/28/335288388/when-did-companies-become-people-excavating-the-legal-evolution\">American corporations are people too</a>, so maybe corporations are capable of more empathy than I give credit. <a href=\"/what-the-hell-do-i-know\">What the hell do I know?</a></p>\n\n<p>Humans had struggled plenty with questions of identity in the analog age. But now they struggle in a new digital frontier that we call the Internet. The Internet started gaining traction with the general public only 30 years or so ago, and we&rsquo;re still adapting to the access that it allows. On one hand, we&rsquo;re still figuring out how much access to give others. On the other hand, we&rsquo;re also figuring out how to handle the access to others that the internet gives us.</p>\n\n<p>Context is sometimes difficult to detect online. And context is an important part of determining which identity to call upon at any moment. It seems that in the online world, you are destined to be all of your selves at once. After all, anyone can learn far too much about you with a couple minutes of <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Google-fu\">Google-fu</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;Hey, I said what I said as some idiot on Twitter,&rdquo; because someone will now pull up your LinkedIn page and argue, &ldquo;No, you said it as CEO of XYZ Widgets, Inc.! XYZ Widgets is horrible! Burn XYZ Widgets to the ground!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>There is no separation of identities online. Maybe that&rsquo;s not a bad thing. Perhaps over time it will require the masses to be more accepting of details in others&rsquo; characters. Yeah, Phyllis in accounting writes Bob The Builder erotica fanfiction in her spare time, but she is <em>great</em> at crunching numbers. And if the masses become more accepting, maybe we&rsquo;ll be more willing to analyze certain details of our own character and be more willing to listen to other opinions and perhaps make healthy changes. One can dream.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve made a few attempts to write under pseudonyms over the years, in the hopes that I could be more honest about certain things. In part I felt that I had the opportunity to reveal and develop a part of my identity that had before been withheld. But I was neglecting another part of my identity as I was not expressing myself as&hellip;well, myself. Vulnerability under another name just doesn&rsquo;t seem genuinely vulnerable to me.</p>\n\n<p>For some reason, it is important to me that my work have my own name on it.

				"content_text": "The concept of identity is a significant struggle for nearly everyone. For most, the struggle has begun by adolescence, when we find ourselves juggling hormones and free thought and free will. This struggle evolves and continues or resurfaces throughout various points of a lifetime: the first time we leave the family nest, the mid-life crisis, and then our turn as empty nesters, just to name a few.\n\nIn order to satisfy the search for our own identities, we have to answer numerous questions about ourselves. Questions of ideology, ethics, morality, sexuality and perhaps even gender. We have to consider how we present ourselves, whom we associate with, and how we respond to offenses both direct and indirect. Every bit of nuance goes into defining an identity. Or perhaps I should say *identities*, as most of us do conduct ourselves differently depending on our audience or company. Most of us do not act the same at work vs. at home or among friends vs. among family. We acknowledge and accept that different scenarios call for different behavior norms. Some would call this being two-faced as if it is merely a character flaw, but I'm sure there is some evolutionary benefit to such behavior. [Likability does have its perks](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-likability-matters-more-at-work-1395788402), after all.\n\nI try to keep my multiple selves as consistent as possible, but there's no denying that I'm different people in different contexts. My opinions are quite different if a microphone is in my face as opposed to what I will say among trusted friends or under the guise of anonymity or a pseudonym.\n\nExactly what or how much is crucial to an individual's identity? What is included and packaged into the whole deal? Our awards and accomplishments? Our voting records? Our charitable causes? The lines are not always so clear. \n\nEven corporations struggle with these questions. Should a corporation just operate within the lens of its industry, or is it required to stand for something outside of its core business? Let's be honest and state the obvious--corporations are purely profit-driven. I do not fault them for that. But since the pursuit of profit is the primary identity of a corporation, I'm usually suspicious whenever a corporation champions a cause. However, the courts have ruled that [American corporations are people too](https://www.npr.org/2014/07/28/335288388/when-did-companies-become-people-excavating-the-legal-evolution), so maybe corporations are capable of more empathy than I give credit. [What the hell do I know?](/what-the-hell-do-i-know)\n\nHumans had struggled plenty with questions of identity in the analog age. But now they struggle in a new digital frontier that we call the Internet. The Internet started gaining traction with the general public only 30 years or so ago, and we're still adapting to the access that it allows. On one hand, we're still figuring out how much access to give others. On the other hand, we're also figuring out how to handle the access to others that the internet gives us.\n\nContext is sometimes difficult to detect online. And context is an important part of determining which identity to call upon at any moment. It seems that in the online world, you are destined to be all of your selves at once. After all, anyone can learn far too much about you with a couple minutes of [Google-fu](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Google-fu). \n\nYou can't say, \"Hey, I said what I said as some idiot on Twitter,\" because someone will now pull up your LinkedIn page and argue, \"No, you said it as CEO of XYZ Widgets, Inc.! XYZ Widgets is horrible! Burn XYZ Widgets to the ground!\"\n\nThere is no separation of identities online. Maybe that's not a bad thing. Perhaps over time it will require the masses to be more accepting of details in others' characters. Yeah, Phyllis in accounting writes Bob The Builder erotica fanfiction in her spare time, but she is *great* at crunching numbers. And if the masses become more accepting, maybe we'll be more willing to analyze certain details of our own character and be more willing to listen to other opinions and perhaps make healthy changes. One can dream.\n\nI've made a few attempts to write under pseudonyms over the years, in the hopes that I could be more honest about certain things. In part I felt that I had the opportunity to reveal and develop a part of my identity that had before been withheld. But I was neglecting another part of my identity as I was not expressing myself as...well, myself. Vulnerability under another name just doesn't seem genuinely vulnerable to me.\n\nFor some reason, it is important to me that my work have my own name on it. I don't know whether this compulsion is due to ego or insecurity. I know only that it exists. Besides, I'm not clever enough to protect my online identity. I know I could easily be found, so if I'm not prepared to face the consequences in my own name, perhaps I just shouldn't say it. But what about art? I feel as if people should strive to separate the art from the artist and not necessarily judge an individual by his output (and vice versa), but it's pretty obvious in 2019 that not everyone agrees with me.\n\nAs a kid, I was afraid of the concept of a \"permanent record\". Now, with the internet, the permanent record has arrived. Put it out there, and it's there for all to see. Screenshot or archived. Forever. This makes me think about how I express myself online. Should I chance pushing a few buttons in the hope of making a point or should I play it safe? Should my online self be bolder like the me among friends, or should the me among friends be more like my online self, more carefully considering and weighing my word choices? Which identity needs to better mirror the other, and how much should either identity give in? Which one assimilates into the other? These are tough questions that lead to considerations of authenticity.\n\nAfter all, if you cater to the crowd too much, people will pick up on it and be turned off. At the same time, it's amazing how offended people can get when you reveal you didn't enjoy their favorite movie. There's a price to pay for honesty, and so there's a price to pay for honest identities.\n",

				"content_html": "\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m a bit of a recovered nice guy. At first glance, <em>nice guy</em> doesn&rsquo;t sound so bad. What can be wrong about being nice, right? But it helps if you say <em>nice guy</em> the way you&rsquo;d say it if you used air quotations when saying it to your friend.</p>\n\n<p>Like this: &ldquo;Nice guy&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Do you get it now? Some people prefer to say *nice guy*‚Ñ¢. There are a number of ways to differentiate, but they all mean the same thing, regardless of which you prefer and utilize.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nice%20Guy\">The second most popular definition of <em>nice guy</em> on Urban Dictionary</a> defines the term as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first being a guy who is genuinely kind and caring. He is polite to everyone regardless of sex, age or race. He has no ulterior motive, i.e. he is not nice to get a reward, he behaves as such because it&rsquo;s human decency.</p>\n\n<p>The second kind of nice guy is the one who has ulterior motives. He believes that because he behaves in a certain way the world owes him for his actions. He doesn&rsquo;t make it clear what he desires from the beginning and becomes angry when he doesn&rsquo;t get what he wants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A <em>nice guy</em> may at times appear to be kind and generous and selfless, but he ultimately falls just short because he lacks one crucial agreement: sincerity. He doesn&rsquo;t perform nice acts because he believes them the thing to do; he performs them because he hopes to get something in return. The <em>nice guy</em> expects others to be mind readers and thinks that he&rsquo;ll have his favors returned even though he&rsquo;s failed to articulate his needs and wants. Eventually, he becomes resentful and creates a victim narrative to communicate just how he&rsquo;s repeatedly been taken advantage of as he wallows in his own misery and pity.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contrary-to-what-the-name-may-lead-one-to-believe-the-nice-guy-is-not-all-that-pleasant-to-be-around\">Contrary to what the name may lead one to believe, the <em>nice guy</em> is not all that pleasant to be around.</h2>\n\n<p>For a significant portion of my life, I exhibited shades of this behavior. Fortunately, I never reached <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incel\">incel</a> status and I never bought a fedora.</p>\n\n<p>Still, I never felt a need to communicate my expectations. I&rsquo;d given so much of myself, so I expected others to do the same. The truth is that I didn&rsquo;t speak up because I didn&rsquo;t know how to ask for things. Or I was afraid of the rejection that I may have experienced if I had made genuine requests. It&rsquo;s ridiculous the lengths we can go to in order to avoid putting ourselves out there. People can&rsquo;t say no if you never ask, right?</p>\n\n<p>On the flipside, it&rsquo;s not hard to see why some people can fall into this trap of supposed virtuous selflessness. It seems as if the call to sacrifice is everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Sacrifice for work. Why give your employer 8 hours a day when you give 12 or 16? And why stop at Monday through Friday? What about <em>weekends</em>?</p>\n\n<p>Sacrifice for your family. Your dreams are dead. Give up on accomplishing anything purely for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Sacrifice for everyone else around you.</p>\n\n<p>Give and give and give and give and put others before yourself because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.

				"content_text": "I'm a bit of a recovered nice guy. At first glance, *nice guy* doesn't sound so bad. What can be wrong about being nice, right? But it helps if you say *nice guy* the way you'd say it if you used air quotations when saying it to your friend.\n\nLike this: \"Nice guy\".\n\nDo you get it now? Some people prefer to say *nice guy*‚Ñ¢. There are a number of ways to differentiate, but they all mean the same thing, regardless of which you prefer and utilize.\n\n[The second most popular definition of *nice guy* on Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nice%20Guy) defines the term as follows:\n\n>The first being a guy who is genuinely kind and caring. He is polite to everyone regardless of sex, age or race. He has no ulterior motive, i.e. he is not nice to get a reward, he behaves as such because it's human decency.\n\n>The second kind of nice guy is the one who has ulterior motives. He believes that because he behaves in a certain way the world owes him for his actions. He doesn't make it clear what he desires from the beginning and becomes angry when he doesn't get what he wants.\n\nA *nice guy* may at times appear to be kind and generous and selfless, but he ultimately falls just short because he lacks one crucial agreement: sincerity. He doesn't perform nice acts because he believes them the thing to do; he performs them because he hopes to get something in return. The *nice guy* expects others to be mind readers and thinks that he'll have his favors returned even though he's failed to articulate his needs and wants. Eventually, he becomes resentful and creates a victim narrative to communicate just how he's repeatedly been taken advantage of as he wallows in his own misery and pity.\n\n## Contrary to what the name may lead one to believe, the *nice guy* is not all that pleasant to be around. \n\nFor a significant portion of my life, I exhibited shades of this behavior. Fortunately, I never reached [incel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incel) status and I never bought a fedora.\n\nStill, I never felt a need to communicate my expectations. I'd given so much of myself, so I expected others to do the same. The truth is that I didn't speak up because I didn't know how to ask for things. Or I was afraid of the rejection that I may have experienced if I had made genuine requests. It's ridiculous the lengths we can go to in order to avoid putting ourselves out there. People can't say no if you never ask, right?\n\nOn the flipside, it's not hard to see why some people can fall into this trap of supposed virtuous selflessness. It seems as if the call to sacrifice is everywhere.\n\nSacrifice for work. Why give your employer 8 hours a day when you give 12 or 16? And why stop at Monday through Friday? What about *weekends*?\n\nSacrifice for your family. Your dreams are dead. Give up on accomplishing anything purely for yourself.\n\nSacrifice for everyone else around you.\n\nGive and give and give and give and put others before yourself because it's the right thing to do. To some, that sounds so lovely. But to me, it sounds like a formula for a hard and heavy burnout. And I don't want any part of that.\n\n## Nah, fam. Homey don't play that no more.\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that I'm human. There's a whole lotta good and a whole lotta ugly that comes with that. And part of the ugly is that I'm a bit selfish. I have things that I want purely for myself. Things that, quite frankly, I really do not want to compromise.\n\nMan, it feels good to say that out loud (or to type it in a blog). It's honest. It's sincere. It's real and it's true.\n\nI've found that by identifying and communicating what I want, I'm much more likely to get what I want and need. And if I have those wants and needs fulfilled, it's much easier to give back to others. I'm able to give more when I'm confident that I'm going to receive something important to me.\n\nThese acknowledgments have been a big part of my recent habit developments.

It doesn't sound glorious and it doesn't paint me as some selfless saint, but it's a lot better than sitting around unhappy saying that I don't have time for myself. \n\nHowever, I can't discount the value of time management for these situations. You can't say you don't have time to take care of yourself when you waste every second of free time mindlessly browsing social media on your phone.

				"content_html": "<p>It was lunchtime on November 28 before I realized the significance of the date. The revelation was discovered due to an innocent conversation with a co-worker. Details about certain family history were questioned. I considered my answer, did some quick math, and then realized what would have been obvious and dreaded by most in my situation: It was <a href=\"/untold-truths-about-loss-and-grief\">the seventh anniversary of my mother&rsquo;s death</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Anniversaries of deaths are a strange thing for me. I often forget about them until some well-meaning individual reaches out to me to say that she&rsquo;s thinking about me. I&rsquo;ll ask myself why this person&rsquo;s so concerned before realizing it&rsquo;s the anniversary of someone&rsquo;s last day on this earth. And then I feel bad for not recognizing the date earlier. It&rsquo;s not as if I don&rsquo;t remember because I don&rsquo;t care. In some way, it&rsquo;s quite the opposite. I tend not to dwell on such anniversaries because I miss my deceased loved ones every day. In that sense, the anniversary truly is just another day.</p>\n\n<p>The last few years have been riddled with loss. The loss of individuals. Relationships. My former self (This loss was probably the least obvious and the hardest to recognize and accept). And so the last few years have certainly had their share of pain, as I&rsquo;m sure almost anyone could understand. There has been a lot to process. There were many lessons that needed to be learned, and some took years to unravel and dissect. But here I am, seven years later, sure of my new truths and realities, and also, in a strange way, I now find myself thankful for the whole experience.</p>\n\n<p>Let me clarify&ndash;that does not mean that I&rsquo;m happy about the losses themselves. My recent past and path are not something for which I would volunteer, nor are they something I&rsquo;d wish upon another individual, even my worst enemy, if such a person existed. But regardless of what I may want or wish for in this life, certain things happened. And so the last few years of my life can be summarized as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You cannot control what happens to you, but you can control your attitude toward what happens to you, and in that, you will be mastering change rather than allowing it to master you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Though <a href=\"/platitudes-vs/\">I&rsquo;m no fan of platitudes</a>, when I find a quote full of wisdom, I have to give it the credit it deserves. Thanks, Brian Tracy, <a href=\"https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/brian_tracy\">whoever you are</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve come to learn that finding lessons in painful experience is one of the better ways in which an individual can heal and grow. The process is not easy. Nor is it pleasant. It takes a lot of self-examination. A lot of self-exploration. A lot of self-critiquing. And maybe even a lot of tears. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that one will find answers or come out better on the other side, but I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s fairly certain what lies ahead if one does not try: a lifetime of personal torture, victimhood, and misery.</p>\n\n<p>In order to get to a better place, I had to learn how to put myself first. &ldquo;Self-centered&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the right term, as it makes one sound selfish. It&rsquo;s a practice I prefer to call being &ldquo;self-concerned&rdquo;. I usually roll my eyes at such linguistic nuances, but this is one that I feel accurately communicates a certain necessity. The process of becoming better through painful experience will most likely require you to take timeouts from other people and their problems and concerns. It&rsquo;s about effectively putting yourself first so that you can eventually give your best self to others.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously my own losses have created a great deal of pain. But I&rsquo;m now at a point where I can appreciate the positive things they&rsquo;ve given me. For one, my experience has given me a greater capacity for empathy, as I&rsquo;m better able to understand what others may be feeling when they&rsquo;re experiencing losses of their own. I&rsquo;ve learned to better appreciate meaningful relationships and the exchanges they allow me to have. And I&rsquo;m also able to appreciate the fleeting precious moments in life that were once so easy to take for granted. Finally&ndash;and perhaps most importantly&ndash;the lessons from my pain have allowed me to feel more useful to others. Because of my experience, I have something more to offer during moments of stress or chaos, and I have to recognize and accept that there was only one way I was able to get to this point. And that way was by moving through the pain instead of trying to avoid and deny it. The peace I now feel seems to have come almost overnight, but I know all too well that it&rsquo;s the product of years of work, which is the reality of almost every overnight success.</p>\n\n<p>This past Thanksgiving I caught myself asking what I was truly thankful for. And I didn&rsquo;t want to say the typical platitudes: my family, my friends, my job, though I am thankful for what I have in each of those categories, and I am in fact thankful for so much more. But on this day in this moment, I found myself considering who I had become and considering how I had become this version of myself that I&rsquo;ve become quite fond of. This person began to form and materialize because of events that started over seven years ago, when I first heard that my mother had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. And so, when I think about it like that, I&rsquo;m thankful for the pain associated with the losses. It&rsquo;s only through the pain that I have been able to learn and become something better than I once was.</p>\n\n<p>Since I began this journey, I stumbled across a quote that has stuck with me and shaped how I see personal tragedy:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It feels good to know that I can confidently say that while I definitely know pain, I do not suffer, and I refuse to do so.

Yet, so many times, to others my shortcomings were either brushed off or completely unnoticed.

				"title": "Writing to Fight the Loneliness",
				"content_html": "<p>Over many moons now I&rsquo;ve asked myself that existential question that every writer asks him or herself: &ldquo;Why do I write?&rdquo; Or maybe even more specifically, &ldquo;Why am I writing about this?&rdquo; And I&rsquo;ve definitely been asking myself that question in regard to this blog and how it&rsquo;s evolved into something deeply personal, something which may turn some people off. Something which at times may concern me. Maybe even scare me a bit. Though hardly anyone reads this blog, it&rsquo;s out there to be found if anyone seeks it. These posts are now public record for anyone to see. This site makes me vulnerable in a way to which I am still adjusting.</p>\n\n<p>After asking these questions about my motivations again and again, I think I&rsquo;ve finally come up with an answer that works. After much soul searching, I&rsquo;ve concluded that I&rsquo;m writing to fight loneliness.</p>\n\n<p>For the most part, writing is a solitary act. One may make the argument that this is not the case with all aspects of writing. For instance, TV show writers often gather around the writer&rsquo;s table to bounce off ideas for how the latest season should play out. Perhaps you have an editor who tells you how to tighten up your projects and how to add a bit of punch to your prose. But more often than not, the actual act of writing requires time alone within your own head, which can obviously make for a lonely time. For better or for worse, I don&rsquo;t collaborate with other writers, nor do I work with an editor. I&rsquo;m flying solo on this one. I&rsquo;m crashing and burning all on my own.</p>\n\n<p>When I say that I&rsquo;m writing to fight loneliness, I&rsquo;m not suggesting that I&rsquo;m writing to fight <em>my</em> loneliness. After all, it&rsquo;s not as if I have any kind of readership or fanbase. I don&rsquo;t allow comments on this blog. Heck, I hardly even promote it. In a strange twist, I&rsquo;m writing in the hope that I can help to fight off someone else&rsquo;s loneliness.</p>\n\n<p>As I&rsquo;ve documented at various points over this blog, I&rsquo;ve hit a few low points over the last few years. I&rsquo;m hardly alone in that, but sometimes that&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to see, because through it all, the absolute worst part was the persistent feeling of loneliness. Anyone who&rsquo;s studied <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/depression/features/depression-traps-and-pitfalls#1\">depression knows that depression and its kin have effective ways of making one feel alienated and withdrawn</a> from the very people who could help the most.</p>\n\n<p>My struggles weren&rsquo;t easy to talk about, and so for the most part, I didn&rsquo;t discuss them. In hindsight, that was obviously a huge mistake. Regardless of what I projected to others, I was not okay. I needed an outlet. I needed a sense of understanding. And so I went searching online.</p>\n\n<p>I found help in some unlikely places in various corners of the internet. I didn&rsquo;t exactly interact with anyone in these corners.

				"content_text": "Over many moons now I've asked myself that existential question that every writer asks him or herself: \"Why do I write?\" Or maybe even more specifically, \"Why am I writing about this?\" And I've definitely been asking myself that question in regard to this blog and how it's evolved into something deeply personal, something which may turn some people off. Something which at times may concern me. Maybe even scare me a bit. Though hardly anyone reads this blog, it's out there to be found if anyone seeks it. These posts are now public record for anyone to see. This site makes me vulnerable in a way to which I am still adjusting.\n\nAfter asking these questions about my motivations again and again, I think I've finally come up with an answer that works. After much soul searching, I've concluded that I'm writing to fight loneliness.\n\nFor the most part, writing is a solitary act. One may make the argument that this is not the case with all aspects of writing. For instance, TV show writers often gather around the writer's table to bounce off ideas for how the latest season should play out. Perhaps you have an editor who tells you how to tighten up your projects and how to add a bit of punch to your prose. But more often than not, the actual act of writing requires time alone within your own head, which can obviously make for a lonely time. For better or for worse, I don't collaborate with other writers, nor do I work with an editor. I'm flying solo on this one. I'm crashing and burning all on my own.\n\nWhen I say that I'm writing to fight loneliness, I'm not suggesting that I'm writing to fight *my* loneliness. After all, it's not as if I have any kind of readership or fanbase. I don't allow comments on this blog. Heck, I hardly even promote it. In a strange twist, I'm writing in the hope that I can help to fight off someone else's loneliness.\n\nAs I've documented at various points over this blog, I've hit a few low points over the last few years. I'm hardly alone in that, but sometimes that's incredibly difficult to see, because through it all, the absolute worst part was the persistent feeling of loneliness. Anyone who's studied [depression knows that depression and its kin have effective ways of making one feel alienated and withdrawn](https://www.webmd.com/depression/features/depression-traps-and-pitfalls#1) from the very people who could help the most.\n\nMy struggles weren't easy to talk about, and so for the most part, I didn't discuss them. In hindsight, that was obviously a huge mistake. Regardless of what I projected to others, I was not okay. I needed an outlet. I needed a sense of understanding. And so I went searching online.\n\nI found help in some unlikely places in various corners of the internet. I didn't exactly interact with anyone in these corners. I sat on the sidelines, merely reading other people's posts and finding solace in our shared experiences and similar pains. In those moments I was no longer alone. One could argue that I wasn't exactly keeping the best company, but I would argue that it was actually the exact company I needed at that time.

And so, for all of those who take the risk and share such things for all to see, I'd like to give one big sincere thank you.

I was in the process of fighting my own demons and always had my eyes open for inspiration and direction. The thing I&rsquo;ve enjoyed most about Isbell&rsquo;s music is his sense of confessionalism. He doesn&rsquo;t shy from his past. Instead, he shares it with his listeners and shows how we can all learn from his own experiences. Isbell gives me hope that we can all become something better than our former selves.

We often think that our heroes are supposed to inspire us to mimic them, but sometimes they can actually demotivate you when you accept that you&rsquo;ll never be able to reach their level of mastery. This describes how I feel about Jason Isbell and also Cormac McCarthy.</p>\n\n<p>I am able to attach personal meaning to so many of Isbell&rsquo;s song but perhaps none moreso than &ldquo;Relatively Easy&rdquo;, because it&rsquo;s a song that I&rsquo;ll forever associate with an extremely painful and transformative personal experience.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rewind-to-fall-2017\">Rewind to fall 2017</h2>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never been particularly fond of doctors&rsquo; offices or hospitals.

I can&rsquo;t help feeling that a similar fate awaits me, and I can&rsquo;t tell you how many symptoms I&rsquo;ve interpreted as a sign that its time has come.

				"title": "Why Not Me? - Coping With Chaos",
				"content_html": "<p>It seems that my blog has mostly become a medium for me to write about revelations from troubling events I endured a few years ago. This was not intentional, but little in my life has ever gone according to any semblance of a plan. Therefore, I suppose my best strategy is to just roll with it, so I&rsquo;m going to take a page from the Nike handbook and Just do it.</p>\n\n<p>There are any number of catastrophes that can plague an individual over the course of his life. Job loss, betrayal, a disabling or terminal diagnosis. Life is full of chaos, and you can be sure that at some point said chaos will swing by to say hi. It&rsquo;s unavoidable. If you haven&rsquo;t encountered a significant challenge yet, count yourself lucky. And then get ready. Buddha himself said it best: &ldquo;Life is suffering.&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t run from it, so you might as well embrace it.</p>\n\n<p>And over the last few years, much of my suffering has stemmed from grief due to loss.</p>\n\n<p>People often wrongly assume that the stages of grief are linear and that they lead to a predictable path out of tragedy. Despite the fact that people can fluctuate in and out of each stage, I&rsquo;ve yet to hear a convincing claim that the stages themselves are bogus.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar, the five stages of grief are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Denial</li>\n<li>Anger</li>\n<li>Bargaining</li>\n<li>Depression</li>\n<li>Acceptance</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m no grief scholar, but I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that one can exhibit denial in a number of ways. One can say something like: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZq_jeYsbTs\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here. This isn&rsquo;t happening.&rdquo;</a></p>\n\n<p>Or one may say: &ldquo;Everything would be better if she were still here,&rdquo; when any sane person knows she can&rsquo;t come back.</p>\n\n<p>And then there&rsquo;s always the fundamental question of &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>And that&rsquo;s where I found myself a few years ago. When one asks &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo;, there&rsquo;s also the implied question &ldquo;What did I do to deserve this?&rdquo; or maybe &ldquo;What could I have done differently?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>These questions aren&rsquo;t inherently bad to ask. Sometimes it can be beneficial to ask these questions if you&rsquo;re willing to have some honest and sincere reflection. For example, if every relationship you have ends in a fiery mess, maybe you&rsquo;re not a good friend or partner. In this situation, there is one constant in each of the failed relationships, and that constant is you.</p>\n\n<p>On the flip side, there are situations over which you had no control. For an example, look no further than <a href=\"/untold-truths-about-loss-and-grief\">one of my early posts</a>. If you want a <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr\">TL;DR</a>, here you go:</p>\n\n<p>Both of my parents were diagnosed with lung cancer in 2011 and died 6 weeks apart. And my stepdad suddenly passed away in 2014.</p>\n\n<p>I know my situation was not the most unique, and there are undoubtedly others who have experienced worse. But I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that my experience was hardly typical. And in my own way, I did find myself asking &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I had great difficulty finding the answer before I ultimately realized that I was looking at the situation wrong and was therefore asking the wrong question. When something truly bothers me, I can get a bit obsessive with finding an answer or solution. In the short-term, this is a negative because I can&rsquo;t let things go. But in the long-term, it&rsquo;s a positive because when I find an answer, it&rsquo;s usually a damn good one, so in the long run, I ultimately find a lasting peace.</p>\n\n<p>Some people say everything happens for a reason, and I myself will even mutter those words at times. But when you get down to it, I believe that the world is full of randomness&ndash;some of which works in your favor and some that doesn&rsquo;t&ndash;and that we attribute our own meaning to experiences and events. I am not saying that our actions do not matter at all; our decisions do have an impact, but we are still at the mercy of the universe and all its disorder and chaos.</p>\n\n<p>And so when I was looking through this lens, I rationalized with myself that if I were to be spared of my pain, then that pain would have to become someone else&rsquo;s burden. I asked myself, Whom would I wish this upon? The answer was pretty obvious and came quickly: No one. Because I couldn&rsquo;t say that anyone deserved the pain. When I was finally able to put the rest of the world on a playing field level with me, I asked myself why I was deserving of an exemption from this randomness. I couldn&rsquo;t think of a good answer.</p>\n\n<p>When I accepted these truths, I was finally able to ask a new question: Why not me? I could not convincingly answer this question either, but this time, that failure actually opened the door to acceptance. It opened the door only a crack, but it was an important step which has gradually allowed me to push the door more and more.</p>\n\n<p>I am just an individual on this earth. In many ways, I have been very fortunate. And I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m any more deserving of my good fortunes than I am of my bad fortunes. I can take credit for some of the events that got me where I am, but I also have to accept the influence of randomness in my life. And I have to accept both sides of the double-edged sword. And so when I find myself in a situation that leads me to ask <em>Why me</em>?, I try to immediately follow it up with <em>Why not me</em>?</p>\n\n<p>In some strange way, it helps me to make sense of the world just a little bit better. I&rsquo;ll never figure out every nuance of the universe and its lessons, so when you get down to it, that&rsquo;s about as good as it can get.</p>\n",

For an example, look no further than [one of my early posts](/untold-truths-about-loss-and-grief). If you want a [TL;DR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr), here you go:\n\nBoth of my parents were diagnosed with lung cancer in 2011 and died 6 weeks apart. And my stepdad suddenly passed away in 2014.\n\nI know my situation was not the most unique, and there are undoubtedly others who have experienced worse. But I think it's safe to say that my experience was hardly typical. And in my own way, I did find myself asking \"Why me?\"\n\nI had great difficulty finding the answer before I ultimately realized that I was looking at the situation wrong and was therefore asking the wrong question. When something truly bothers me, I can get a bit obsessive with finding an answer or solution. In the short-term, this is a negative because I can't let things go. But in the long-term, it's a positive because when I find an answer, it's usually a damn good one, so in the long run, I ultimately find a lasting peace.\n\nSome people say everything happens for a reason, and I myself will even mutter those words at times. But when you get down to it, I believe that the world is full of randomness--some of which works in your favor and some that doesn't--and that we attribute our own meaning to experiences and events. I am not saying that our actions do not matter at all; our decisions do have an impact, but we are still at the mercy of the universe and all its disorder and chaos.\n\nAnd so when I was looking through this lens, I rationalized with myself that if I were to be spared of my pain, then that pain would have to become someone else's burden. I asked myself, Whom would I wish this upon? The answer was pretty obvious and came quickly: No one. Because I couldn't say that anyone deserved the pain. When I was finally able to put the rest of the world on a playing field level with me, I asked myself why I was deserving of an exemption from this randomness. I couldn't think of a good answer.\n\nWhen I accepted these truths, I was finally able to ask a new question: Why not me? I could not convincingly answer this question either, but this time, that failure actually opened the door to acceptance. It opened the door only a crack, but it was an important step which has gradually allowed me to push the door more and more.\n\nI am just an individual on this earth. In many ways, I have been very fortunate. And I can't say that I'm any more deserving of my good fortunes than I am of my bad fortunes. I can take credit for some of the events that got me where I am, but I also have to accept the influence of randomness in my life. And I have to accept both sides of the double-edged sword. And so when I find myself in a situation that leads me to ask *Why me*?, I try to immediately follow it up with *Why not me*?\n\nIn some strange way, it helps me to make sense of the world just a little bit better. I'll never figure out every nuance of the universe and its lessons, so when you get down to it, that's about as good as it can get.\n",

				"title": "Untold Truths About Grief",
				"content_html": "\n\n<p>From time to time, someone will accuse me of having a morbid fascination with death. I‚Äôd argue that fascination is a bit inaccurate; my relationship with death is closer to a familiarity slowly working its way toward acceptance. Those who know me beyond the most superficial terms know that death and the resulting losses and grief have had a big influence on me over the last few years. In short, loss has opened my eyes to certain realities, has shaped so many of my views, and has changed the very essence of who I am.</p>\n\n<p>In the Spring of 2011, my mother was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. I took the news as a heavy blow. Then, a few months later, my father received a similar diagnosis: lung cancer, though a different form. If that wasn‚Äôt enough to try to deal with, the progressions of their cancers certainly were.</p>\n\n<p>My mother‚Äôs battle with cancer lasted seven or eight months. About four months before she ultimately passed away, she was pronounced dead when she stopped breathing for a few minutes. Per my mother‚Äôs wishes, my stepfather fulfilled the unenviable task of asking the doctor not to resuscitate her. But, somehow, my mother sprang back to life and continued fighting for a few more months before ultimately passing away a couple days after Thanksgiving. During that time, everyone around her watched her deteriorate and wither away, and those images still haunt me going on seven years later. As strange as this may sound, it‚Äôs easier to accept her death than it is to accept how she died. Whether logical or not, I can‚Äôt help feeling that a similar fate awaits me at some point.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike the case with my mother, my father passed away pretty quickly after his diagnosis. He didn‚Äôt quite make it a month. I was scheduled to visit him two days after he passed. To make matters worse, I hadn‚Äôt seen my father in about two and a half years. So, that obviously brings its own pains and guilt that I don‚Äôt think I really need to explain or elaborate.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the losses didn‚Äôt stop there. In 2014, I lost my stepfather, who passed away due to complications from diabetes. Unlike the case with my parents, his death caught me completely off-guard. I knew that he was having health problems, but I had never considered the possibility of death. Or if I had, I likely felt that death would be a bit further down the road.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever I relay these details, I catch myself wondering if that is indeed how it happened. Even now, just the thought of having to deal with those losses in such fashion shakes me. These losses were so close together‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially the losses of my parents‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand each played out in its own unique way. When I contrast and compare them, I‚Äôm able to come up with a variety of takeaways that I feel are worth sharing.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"there-is-no-perfect-closure\">There is no perfect closure.</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes it can seem as if we‚Äôre concerned with the idea of an ideal death. We convince ourselves that if things play out a certain way, maybe the whole experience won‚Äôt be too painful.</p>\n\n<p>Each loss I suffered was a unique experience with unique grief. I can‚Äôt say that I fully prefer one to the other. While I‚Äôm grateful that I was able to have more time with my mother, I know that every moment she was alive led to incredible pain and torture for her. I can only imagine the conflict of wanting your suffering to end but also knowing that the end will come only at the event of your passing. Looking back, I now realize what a gift it is to have no hatchets to bury and no wrongs to right. If you have the opportunity to set things right before tragedy strikes, I highly recommend that you do it. Doing so will allow you to focus on the things that truly matter and will help to bring a little order to the chaos.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, I wish I‚Äôd had the opportunity to see my father one last time, but at least he didn‚Äôt have to suffer as long as my mother did. While his quick passing does bring its own comforts, it also denied the opportunity for certain conversations I wish had been had. If I‚Äôm being completely honest and self-aware, I likely wouldn‚Äôt have had the courage to initiate these conversations, as it‚Äôs taken me nearly seven years to sort through my feelings to coherently articulate said feelings, but as things played out, I never had the chance. And that‚Äôs something I wish I could change.</p>\n\n<p>And with my stepfather‚Äôs passing, I learned what it was like to truly be shocked when someone leaves this world unexpectedly. There‚Äôs a big difference between accepting that someone has finally passed and accepting that someone has abruptly passed. But both situations have one thing in common‚Äìpain and suffering. You can sit around and philosophize about which flavor you prefer, but at the end of the day you‚Äôre still eating a dish you wish you‚Äôd never been served. Kind of like Grandma‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.riverfronttimes.com/foodblog/2010/02/16/20-unholy-recipes-dishes-so-awful-we-had-to-make-them\">vienna sausage shortcake</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"grief-is-not-linear\">Grief is not linear.</h2>\n\n<p>Rather than acknowledge my grief and seek help of any sort, I repeatedly told myself that I should be over it by now. It‚Äôd been a year or two years or three years‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähow long was I going to take to get over these deaths? When would I be okay? When would I feel normal again?</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôve accepted that I will never get over these losses. Instead, I must continue to learn how to live with them. I‚Äôve come to realize that on any given day, I have no clue what will trigger or stir a reaction in me. Just when I think it‚Äôll never bother me again, I watch a movie or a TV show centered around the themes of death and loss and my eyes fill up. Even though I can‚Äôt articulate what exactly is going on inside, I allow myself to feel it. And that‚Äôs something that took years to find the courage to do.</p>\n\n<p>The journey is not straight. Along the way you‚Äôll encounter many strange paths, and at times you may find yourself feeling as if you‚Äôre possibly regressing. That‚Äôs okay; it‚Äôs part of the process. You can‚Äôt take your hands off the wheel and just coast to the finish line; get ready for some curves and u-turns.</p>\n\n<p><em>The only way out is through.</em></p>\n\n<p>So stop <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XN0NtrnfMY\">looking forward on paths sideways</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"don-t-invalidate-your-grief\">Don‚Äôt invalidate your grief.</h2>\n\n<p>At some point, I finally realized that I simply wasn‚Äôt giving myself permission to grieve. This halted my healing for years. One common way I invalidated my grief was by telling myself that there were some who had had it far worse.</p>\n\n<p>*Some people lost their parents when they were much younger.</p>\n\n<p>Some people had lost family due to murder or wars.*</p>\n\n<p>Comparing and contrasting grief in this manner does very little good. The fact remains that my experience still sucked, and I have no problem saying that now. When I say it, I‚Äôm not asking for pity. I‚Äôm simply acknowledging the situation.</p>\n\n<p><em>It sucked. It still does.</em></p>\n\n<p>When I think about this point, I‚Äôm always reminded of the time I heard a hospice representative ask, ‚ÄúWhat is the greatest pain the world?‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>The group I was in offered various answers, but the most popular answer by far was <em>the death of a child</em>. Who‚Äôs going to argue that one, right?</p>\n\n<p>But I now realize that the death of a child can be the greatest pain in the world only if you‚Äôve experienced it, because as the the hospice worker made me realize when she answered her question, the greatest pain in the world is whatever pain you‚Äôre experiencing at the moment. This realization has made it much easier for me to offer compassion to the pains of others as well as the pains of my own. In the end, it doesn‚Äôt matter how my pain stacks up to others‚Äô; my pain is my own, and it‚Äôs the only pain I truly know.</p>\n\n<p>Also, dealing with these kinds of matters is a balance. Yes, there are times when you just have to box up your feelings and get through the day. But you do have to give yourself the opportunity to be real about how you‚Äôre feeling. Otherwise, how else can you ever hope to improve your feelings if you never acknowledge their true intricacies?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bring-on-the-empathy\">Bring on the empathy.</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúI always cry at funerals, even if I didn‚Äôt know the person.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMy Uncle Cecil, at my grandfather‚Äôs funeral</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I was fifteen years old when I heard those words from my Uncle Cecil. At the time, I hadn‚Äôt had the life experience to understand and appreciate what he was saying. But I like to think I now have a much better idea, because these days I never know when a certain moment may move me to tears. Maybe the tears will come when a co-worker starts crying during her retirement party when she becomes a mess of emotions as she‚Äôs so excited to say hello to a new chapter of her life while she‚Äôs also afraid of saying goodbye to a familiar chapter. Or maybe they‚Äôll come when I find myself an absolute mess at the end of The Iron Giant. (Before you ask, yes, both of those things have actually happened.)</p>\n\n<p>While these moments can lead to embarrassment, they also allow for greater connection with others as well as with myself. Sometimes these moments are in no way obviously related to my experiences with loss. I like to think that simply being reminded time and time again about the fleeting nature of life has given me an ability to realize emotions that were once seemingly unreachable. Regardless of whether my theory is spot-on or completely vain, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee925OTFBCA\">sometimes you just need a good cry</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"death-is-something-we-need-to-talk-about-more\">Death is something we need to talk about more.</h2>\n\n<p>Death is inevitable, no matter how hard we may try to deny it. If you really think about it, death is the last major event of life. We need to acknowledge this without letting fear get in the way. The least we can do is try to face our end with some dignity.</p>\n\n<p>For the first couple years of my son‚Äôs life, I felt bad for him because before he was even born, he‚Äôd already lost out on so much love from people expected to be close to him. While I‚Äôm still bothered by this fact, it does help to know that I have the opportunity to teach him things that most parents aren‚Äôt equipped for. I‚Äôm still not sure about the timing or the exact technique, but I do understand the importance and I know that it‚Äôs something I won‚Äôt back down from.</p>\n\n<p>Death and loss are part of the human experience, and we‚Äôre doing ourselves a disservice when we refuse to acknowledge that fact. Also, I like to think that as we become more comfortable with the certainty of death, we also find the clarity for better living.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"it-feels-good-to-think-i-can-help-others\">It feels good to think I can help others.</h2>\n\n<p>One thing that lessens the pain is finding a way to come away with lessons from this experience. And it helps even more if I can find a way to pass those lessons on to others who may need them. I‚Äôm well aware what the pain of loss is like, and if I can help to alleviate that pain for someone else for even a tiny bit, I consider it a good deed done. I‚Äôve also learned that it often helps to know that you‚Äôre not alone, no matter what‚Äôs ailing you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"but-if-i-m-being-honest-it-isn-t-all-about-helping-others\">But if I‚Äôm being honest, it isn‚Äôt all about helping others.</h2>\n\n<p>I wish I could claim to be completely selfless. But the truth is that talking about my experience is an outlet, and finding outlets helps me. Also, every time I‚Äôm able to share my story, I find something new. I find another layer to the onion. I take away something new, and I grow just a little bit more. And so I like to think that by helping myself I‚Äôm able to help others, which may not sound very altruistic, but I do think it‚Äôs real.</p>\n\n<p>Refusing to be real about this part of my life took a toll on me in a number of ways. It beat me down and got the best of me. It filled a significant chunk of my life with darkness and robbed me of so much potential joy. In short, it simply wasn‚Äôt working. And when what you‚Äôve been trying hasn‚Äôt been working, it‚Äôs time to try something new. And this post is part of my new effort to be more open about my experience.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for me letting me share a bit of myself with you.</p>\n",

I took the news as a heavy blow. Then, a few months later, my father received a similar diagnosis: lung cancer, though a different form. If that wasn‚Äôt enough to try to deal with, the progressions of their cancers certainly were.\n\nMy mother‚Äôs battle with cancer lasted seven or eight months. About four months before she ultimately passed away, she was pronounced dead when she stopped breathing for a few minutes. Per my mother‚Äôs wishes, my stepfather fulfilled the unenviable task of asking the doctor not to resuscitate her. But, somehow, my mother sprang back to life and continued fighting for a few more months before ultimately passing away a couple days after Thanksgiving. During that time, everyone around her watched her deteriorate and wither away, and those images still haunt me going on seven years later. As strange as this may sound, it‚Äôs easier to accept her death than it is to accept how she died. Whether logical or not, I can‚Äôt help feeling that a similar fate awaits me at some point.\n\nUnlike the case with my mother, my father passed away pretty quickly after his diagnosis. He didn‚Äôt quite make it a month. I was scheduled to visit him two days after he passed. To make matters worse, I hadn‚Äôt seen my father in about two and a half years. So, that obviously brings its own pains and guilt that I don‚Äôt think I really need to explain or elaborate.\n\nUnfortunately, the losses didn‚Äôt stop there. In 2014, I lost my stepfather, who passed away due to complications from diabetes. Unlike the case with my parents, his death caught me completely off-guard. I knew that he was having health problems, but I had never considered the possibility of death. Or if I had, I likely felt that death would be a bit further down the road.\n\nWhenever I relay these details, I catch myself wondering if that is indeed how it happened. Even now, just the thought of having to deal with those losses in such fashion shakes me. These losses were so close together‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially the losses of my parents‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand each played out in its own unique way. When I contrast and compare them, I‚Äôm able to come up with a variety of takeaways that I feel are worth sharing.\n\n## There is no perfect closure.\n\nSometimes it can seem as if we‚Äôre concerned with the idea of an ideal death. We convince ourselves that if things play out a certain way, maybe the whole experience won‚Äôt be too painful.\n\nEach loss I suffered was a unique experience with unique grief. I can‚Äôt say that I fully prefer one to the other. While I‚Äôm grateful that I was able to have more time with my mother, I know that every moment she was alive led to incredible pain and torture for her. I can only imagine the conflict of wanting your suffering to end but also knowing that the end will come only at the event of your passing. Looking back, I now realize what a gift it is to have no hatchets to bury and no wrongs to right. If you have the opportunity to set things right before tragedy strikes, I highly recommend that you do it. Doing so will allow you to focus on the things that truly matter and will help to bring a little order to the chaos.\n\nObviously, I wish I‚Äôd had the opportunity to see my father one last time, but at least he didn‚Äôt have to suffer as long as my mother did. While his quick passing does bring its own comforts, it also denied the opportunity for certain conversations I wish had been had. If I‚Äôm being completely honest and self-aware, I likely wouldn‚Äôt have had the courage to initiate these conversations, as it‚Äôs taken me nearly seven years to sort through my feelings to coherently articulate said feelings, but as things played out, I never had the chance. And that‚Äôs something I wish I could change.\n\nAnd with my stepfather‚Äôs passing, I learned what it was like to truly be shocked when someone leaves this world unexpectedly. There‚Äôs a big difference between accepting that someone has finally passed and accepting that someone has abruptly passed. But both situations have one thing in common‚Äìpain and suffering. You can sit around and philosophize about which flavor you prefer, but at the end of the day you‚Äôre still eating a dish you wish you‚Äôd never been served. Kind of like Grandma‚Äôs [vienna sausage shortcake](https://www.riverfronttimes.com/foodblog/2010/02/16/20-unholy-recipes-dishes-so-awful-we-had-to-make-them).\n\n## Grief is not linear.\n\nRather than acknowledge my grief and seek help of any sort, I repeatedly told myself that I should be over it by now. It‚Äôd been a year or two years or three years‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähow long was I going to take to get over these deaths? When would I be okay? When would I feel normal again?\n\nI‚Äôve accepted that I will never get over these losses. Instead, I must continue to learn how to live with them. I‚Äôve come to realize that on any given day, I have no clue what will trigger or stir a reaction in me. Just when I think it‚Äôll never bother me again, I watch a movie or a TV show centered around the themes of death and loss and my eyes fill up. Even though I can‚Äôt articulate what exactly is going on inside, I allow myself to feel it. And that‚Äôs something that took years to find the courage to do.\n\nThe journey is not straight. Along the way you‚Äôll encounter many strange paths, and at times you may find yourself feeling as if you‚Äôre possibly regressing. That‚Äôs okay; it‚Äôs part of the process. You can‚Äôt take your hands off the wheel and just coast to the finish line; get ready for some curves and u-turns.\n\n*The only way out is through.*\n\nSo stop [looking forward on paths sideways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XN0NtrnfMY).\n\n## Don‚Äôt invalidate your grief.\n\nAt some point, I finally realized that I simply wasn‚Äôt giving myself permission to grieve. This halted my healing for years. One common way I invalidated my grief was by telling myself that there were some who had had it far worse.\n\n*Some people lost their parents when they were much younger.\n\nSome people had lost family due to murder or wars.*\n\nComparing and contrasting grief in this manner does very little good. The fact remains that my experience still sucked, and I have no problem saying that now. When I say it, I‚Äôm not asking for pity. I‚Äôm simply acknowledging the situation.\n\n*It sucked. It still does.*\n\nWhen I think about this point, I‚Äôm always reminded of the time I heard a hospice representative ask, ‚ÄúWhat is the greatest pain the world?‚Äù\n\nThe group I was in offered various answers, but the most popular answer by far was *the death of a child*. Who‚Äôs going to argue that one, right?\n\nBut I now realize that the death of a child can be the greatest pain in the world only if you‚Äôve experienced it, because as the the hospice worker made me realize when she answered her question, the greatest pain in the world is whatever pain you‚Äôre experiencing at the moment. This realization has made it much easier for me to offer compassion to the pains of others as well as the pains of my own. In the end, it doesn‚Äôt matter how my pain stacks up to others‚Äô; my pain is my own, and it‚Äôs the only pain I truly know.\n\nAlso, dealing with these kinds of matters is a balance. Yes, there are times when you just have to box up your feelings and get through the day. But you do have to give yourself the opportunity to be real about how you‚Äôre feeling. Otherwise, how else can you ever hope to improve your feelings if you never acknowledge their true intricacies?\n\n## Bring on the empathy.\n\n> ‚ÄúI always cry at funerals, even if I didn‚Äôt know the person.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMy Uncle Cecil, at my grandfather‚Äôs funeral\n\nI was fifteen years old when I heard those words from my Uncle Cecil. At the time, I hadn‚Äôt had the life experience to understand and appreciate what he was saying. But I like to think I now have a much better idea, because these days I never know when a certain moment may move me to tears. Maybe the tears will come when a co-worker starts crying during her retirement party when she becomes a mess of emotions as she‚Äôs so excited to say hello to a new chapter of her life while she‚Äôs also afraid of saying goodbye to a familiar chapter. Or maybe they‚Äôll come when I find myself an absolute mess at the end of The Iron Giant. (Before you ask, yes, both of those things have actually happened.)\n\nWhile these moments can lead to embarrassment, they also allow for greater connection with others as well as with myself. Sometimes these moments are in no way obviously related to my experiences with loss. I like to think that simply being reminded time and time again about the fleeting nature of life has given me an ability to realize emotions that were once seemingly unreachable. Regardless of whether my theory is spot-on or completely vain, [sometimes you just need a good cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee925OTFBCA)\n\n## Death is something we need to talk about more.\n\nDeath is inevitable, no matter how hard we may try to deny it. If you really think about it, death is the last major event of life. We need to acknowledge this without letting fear get in the way. The least we can do is try to face our end with some dignity.\n\nFor the first couple years of my son‚Äôs life, I felt bad for him because before he was even born, he‚Äôd already lost out on so much love from people expected to be close to him. While I‚Äôm still bothered by this fact, it does help to know that I have the opportunity to teach him things that most parents aren‚Äôt equipped for. I‚Äôm still not sure about the timing or the exact technique, but I do understand the importance and I know that it‚Äôs something I won‚Äôt back down from.\n\nDeath and loss are part of the human experience, and we‚Äôre doing ourselves a disservice when we refuse to acknowledge that fact. Also, I like to think that as we become more comfortable with the certainty of death, we also find the clarity for better living.\n\n## It feels good to think I can help others.\n\nOne thing that lessens the pain is finding a way to come away with lessons from this experience. And it helps even more if I can find a way to pass those lessons on to others who may need them. I‚Äôm well aware what the pain of loss is like, and if I can help to alleviate that pain for someone else for even a tiny bit, I consider it a good deed done. I‚Äôve also learned that it often helps to know that you‚Äôre not alone, no matter what‚Äôs ailing you.\n\n## But if I‚Äôm being honest, it isn‚Äôt all about helping others.\n\nI wish I could claim to be completely selfless. But the truth is that talking about my experience is an outlet, and finding outlets helps me. Also, every time I‚Äôm able to share my story, I find something new. I find another layer to the onion. I take away something new, and I grow just a little bit more. And so I like to think that by helping myself I‚Äôm able to help others, which may not sound very altruistic, but I do think it‚Äôs real.\n\nRefusing to be real about this part of my life took a toll on me in a number of ways. It beat me down and got the best of me. It filled a significant chunk of my life with darkness and robbed me of so much potential joy. In short, it simply wasn‚Äôt working. And when what you‚Äôve been trying hasn‚Äôt been working, it‚Äôs time to try something new. And this post is part of my new effort to be more open about my experience.\n\nThank you for me letting me share a bit of myself with you.\n",
